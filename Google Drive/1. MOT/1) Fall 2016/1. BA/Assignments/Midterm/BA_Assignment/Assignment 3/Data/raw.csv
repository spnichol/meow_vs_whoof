I knew there were people living in poverty; however it was easy to put those thoughts out of my head with the distractions of my daily routine.  A couple of years ago, God removed the blinders from my eyes, and allowed me to see how truly blessed my family and many other families here in America are compared to other parts of the world.  In the process, I was astonished to discover that about 1.5 billion people in our world live on less than $1.25 per day.  How does someone even live on $1.25 per day, when many of us here in America are willing to pay more than $1.25 for a cup of coffee?    \n\nAfter God began revealing this to my husband and me, we felt called to do something to help.  I just could not sit back anymore and pretend I didn’t know that others were living in such dire circumstances, and I truly wanted to do something to give back.  My husband and I were led to an organization called 25:40 which helps orphans and underprivileged children in South Africa.  We were drawn to this organization, first and foremost because of the organization’s name 25:40, drawn from Matthew 25:40 “Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.”   After hearing stories about many of the children they serve and how they were partnering with the community to help fix the problems with sustainable solutions, I felt compelled to join efforts with them and do something to help raise money for the least of these through this wonderful organization.      \n\nBeing a dancer for 18 years, I have much passion and love for dancing.  God opened up a door to dance ministry a couple of years ago and through some prayer I decided to do a dance workshop over one summer to help benefit 25:40.  It was such a blessing for me to be involved with dance again and at the same time such an amazing opportunity for me to use my time, talents, and passions to help these children in South Africa who so desperately needed our help.    \n\nDuring the workshop I was also able to talk about some of the children that 25:40 serves.  How some of these children lived in small huts with no floors or had to walk every day long distances to collect water for their family.  The children would ask me if I was making these stories up since it was so hard for them to even imagine life as these children in South Africa know it.  It was very heartwarming to see some of the children come to the workshop, emptying their own piggy banks to give back after hearing the stories of the children 25:40 serves.  In addition to the money we were able to raise for 25:40 during the workshop, I know the workshop make a great impact on those children’s hearts and also mine as well.    \n\nI feel very blessed to have had the opportunity to give back and help children in South Africa through 25:40.  I learned through this giving experience that God is calling us all to do something, and in the process to be the hands and feet of Jesus.  We can have such an amazing impact on this world if we are mindful of what is going on within it and make the commitment that we will do what we can to help.  I believe that when we give of our time, talents, and treasures we can also be a part of something much bigger than ourselves!  And as we join forces with God to do something to help others, I think we will be amazed to see that not only will other’s lives be helped and impacted because of it, but our own life will be changed as well as our hearts are transformed to be more like His.  I know mine has and it is a beautiful thing!             \n",3,2

Those things that can make a difference, not only in my life, but in the lives of people around me, are what I choose to focus on and that is what inspires me to give. \n\nA few years ago, after dealing with the sudden death of my father, struggling with my mother battling cancer, and coping with the overwhelming depression brought on by infertility, I found myself in a foreign country doing a VBS missions trip with children. I caught myself standing in a room full of impoverished people, looking around the room as they raised their hands to God and they not only prayed for their struggles, but THANKED Him for the little that they had. \n\nWhile there I also met a man who had a crippling disease and he told me of his pain and suffering. He went on to share with me the abandonment he had as a teenager, the torment of having his best friend murdered and die in his arms, and the struggles of poverty and starvation. He also shared with me his faith. He told me of a time when he was at rock bottom.  He had no food, no money, no home, and no one to turn to, but it was a sacrifice he was willing to suffer for because he was trying to make a difference in the lives of others. He was given the opportunity to leave, to escape this torment and leave it all behind.  He had a choice to make and he chose to give his life to those in need rather than run because he had faith that God would provide. It was at this moment in his story that I realized my life meant nothing if all I was doing was living for myself and I vowed to change the things that I could and leave the rest to God.\n\nI knew that I wanted to make a difference in this world and I knew that the change needed to start with myself. I changed the way I ate and I changed the way I lived. In fact, I changed so much that I lost 100lbs in less than a year and completed a triathlon. Not only did I change my appearance but I changed my outlook on life. I started small by helping the man that I met, sending him money when I thought he would need it. After all, this man changed my life and I wanted to change his.  \n\nOur friendship led me to Honduras where he was living and helping in an elementary school. I met and fell in love with each and every 104 students that were in that school. They showed me a love that I had never experienced before. They looked at me as a mother, a friend, even an angel of hope with tears in their eyes and smiles on their faces. How do you walk away from that? You can't! To look around at the community and see fathers to had abandoned their families, parents who had been murdered, children who were beaten and abused, living in homes made of mud, sheets, and broken pieces of wood; walking away was not an option. We wanted to do whatever was possible for these kids, but with no money it seemed incredibly difficult. Difficult, but not impossible. We looked for the things we were able to change, and we started teaching them. \n\nWe started with English lessons in the elementary school, teaching them a skill that they could use to get a job with no further education, but it wasn't enough. The government in Honduras only provides schooling through 6th grade, after that the families have to pay for school. In this community they are too poor to advance past 6th grade. So after a few months we came to the decision to start a school for these kids, grades 7, 8, and 9.  We had nothing to start with, nothing but the desire and the Faith that God would provide.\n\nGod provided! We found an organization to help us, one that believes in making a difference in the world, no matter how small. The efforts of this organization not only help our school in Honduras but they help schools in other countries like Burundi and Uganda, they help in the Philippines, in Haiti and are now making efforts to join the war against human trafficking in the United States.  Supporting the organization, 3rd World People, is near and dear to my heart because, like me, and like my partner, they believe in doing whatever you can to make the changes that are possible and leave the rest to God.\n\nWe are now nearing the end of our second school year and we have plans to start a bakery for the school. They will not only be able to learn lessons that will help them in their futures, but we will be able to generate an income for the school to pay for our teachers and supplies. We are excited for the future of our school and we couldn't be more proud of our students. They are bright, caring, and funny and they are a constant reminder to us that although we can't do everything, we can do something, and we can change the world! \n\nFind us on Facebook (Teach Honduras, Pinares High School)\n\nWww.3rdwp.org\n",1,2

Maybe they will notice the loud sounds some of them make at inappropriate times or the braces on their legs.  Since some children are non-verbal, people might not realize their intelligence, sense of humor or desire to engage with those around them.  But at Access Services, they see other things.  They see the different ways people are smart.  There are no tests that can capture it.  They see young people, who because of their autism, have a superior ability to focus on details and sustain attention when immersed in activities they love.  They see students with cerebral palsy, and although every movement they make requires exceptional effort, they push through to claim their independence and complete daily activities that many of us take for granted.  \n\nSometimes the challenges children face are more difficult to outwardly observe.  Our communities are able to document and measure truancy and delinquency statistics, but the underlying causes, including mental health issues, addiction and abuse are often invisible and more difficult to quantify.  It is certainly easy to become overwhelmed!\n\nAt Access Services, they meet these challenges with innovative programming, exceptionally committed staff and evidence based, strategic intervention to transform the lives of the children and teens who they serve.  Where others see hopelessness, they see potential and possibility.  It is common for others to view children with disabilities as “broken,” needing to be “fixed.”  But at Access Services, they passionately believe that all children are “whole.” They deserve the best opportunities to develop, thrive and engage productively within their families and communities.  I support Access Services because they share my commitment to making this world a better place for individuals of all abilities.  They back their philosophy will concrete action, affecting thousands of lives a year, with a focus on creating a meaningful difference one person at a time.  I hope you will join me in supporting Access Services.  Learn more about them at www.accessservices.org\n\n",2,6

The baby was blue, weighed less than four pounds, and had some type of serious heart “problem.”  That child was me.\n     As a child, I never really understood exactly what condition I had or its  severity.  My pediatrician only noted that I had a heart murmur.  In hindsight, I can appreciate that in the late 1950s, medical science and diagnostic tools weren't where they are today, making an accurate and complete diagnosis difficult. I only knew that I got tired easily during gym class, couldn’t run as fast as everyone else, and had trouble keeping off weight.  \n     Not knowing the severity of my condition and any limitations it posed, I was determined from an early age to attend the Naval Academy.  My dad was a U.S. Naval Academy graduate and was killed serving his country when I was six months old.  It was my long-standing goal to honor his memory by attending the Academy and becoming a career officer.  Finally, it seemed that my wish would become reality--I was thrilled when I was in the first group of women selected to attend the Academy, pending medical clearance.  \n     It was when I had to undergo the pre-admission comprehensive medical exam that my complete congenital heart issues were made clear. I had Ebstein’s Anomaly, a rare congenital defect. I was denied admittance to the Academy because my heart posed too much of a risk. I was devastated.\n     This was the first time I had experienced any major limitations or discrimination based on my heart disease. I was angry, and vowed I would do my best to stay as fit and healthy as possible.  \n     I always felt somewhat alone with my disease, having a condition that many doctors didn't even know about.  I would go for checkups and more often than not interns would come in to listen to my heart.  Then, one day while at work, I was discussing weekend plans with a colleague.  I mentioned that I was going to Boston for my annual cardiologist visit.  She inquired why I was traveling so far (I worked in New Jersey at the time) and I informed her that I had a rather rare condition called Ebstein's Anomaly.  She broke down in tears, and I couldn't understand why.  Through her tears, my colleague told me that her baby daughter was just diagnosed with the same condition.  She had been told that most children born with Ebstein's do not make it to adulthood.  She said knowing that I have this condition gave her hope.  Seeing her pain turn to joy planted in me the desire to one day work with women and children with heart disease.\n     Somehow, somewhere, I found the Adult Congenital Heart Association’s website, www.achaheart.org. In reading through its mission, I immediately felt a connection and knew that I wanted to volunteer with this wonderful organization.  \n     The mission of the Adult Congenital Heart Association  (ACHA) is to improve and extend the lives of the millions born with heart defects through education, advocacy and the promotion of research.  The ACHA website, print materials, media outreach, educational events and advocacy events allow ACHA to reach out to adults with CHD and advocate for the ACHD community. ACHA offers information directly to patients and families, and provides materials and services through health-professional members.  ACHA was founded in 1998 by a group of adult congenital heart defect survivors and their families as a national 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization.   \n     ACHA is dedicated to promoting excellence in ACHD care.  Thanks to medical improvements, the number of adults living with congenital heart disease is now greater than the number of children.  It is critical for these adults to receive life-long care with a cardiologist specializing in adult congenital heart disease.  Advocating for the availability of such care is a main goal of ACHA.\n     It has been an honor and privilege to volunteer with this wonderful organization.  Through the ACHA Heart-to-Heart Ambassador program, I am able to provide one-on-one peer support and encouragement to those living with congenital heart disease.  The Ambassador program not only provides one-time matches but 3 month matches, enabling Ambassadors to help those with longer term concerns, such as preparing for surgery.\n     One of my most memorable experiences with ACHA was volunteering at the Congenital Heart Walk in Boston, Massachusetts.  In spite of the nasty rainy weather, hundreds came out to walk a mile in support of or in memory of those with CHD.  Along with raising funds for congenital heart research, these walks provide a communal opportunity for congenital heart “families” to support and encourage each other.\n     The ACHA has been there for me as well.  I had my first open heart surgery—at age 57--6 months ago.  The support, encouragement, and advice from fellow ACHAers was a true blessing.  With ACHA, I no longer feel alone.  With ACHA, I intend to provide support for other adults living with congenital heart disease for a long time, helping them thrive, not just survive.\n",1,2

In my mind, I was doing 'the best I could' by volunteering on select weekends at our local animal shelter, by purchasing a toy each year at Christmas for a child in need, or by donating unwanted clothing to our city's women's shelter. It wasn't until I moved to Georgia and started working at Advocates for Children in 2013 that I learned the value and the true meaning of giving.\n\nAdvocates is a non-profit organization providing many programs and services geared toward the prevention and treatment of child abuse and neglect. Now, I am no stranger to studying the many socioeconomic problems that communities face. I was, in fact, a Sociology major. Contrary to my own beliefs, I was quite sheltered in seeing the reality of the hardships that many families, especially the children, endure in the face of poverty. I saw, and heard those stories first hand when I began interacting with the children at Flowering Branch Children's Shelter, one of Advocates' eight programs. \n\nI had worked at Advocates for less than two months when one of our youngest residents made his way up to my office to barter a handmade drawing for one of the lollipops in my candy jar. He was a new resident who had not yet settled in, and was quite down since we were nearing the holidays and he was separated from his little sister. In our few short minutes of conversation, it occurred to me how mature this sweet, soft spoken young boy was. \n\nAt only 11 years old, he was forced to care for himself, foraging for food and finding shelter wherever possible. He shared stories of his life and experiences as if they were normal children's activities. As if sleeping in the rain, eating food from dumpsters, and traveling busy highways in the dark of night were comparable to building a puzzle, playing tag, or watching a movie. Not once did he talk about his life as if it was lacking, in fact, he was proud. He eagerly showed off his light up shoes, riddled with holes, plagued by a dying battery. He was beaming with joy when we told him that he would get Christmas gifts in just a few short weeks, not because he was excited to beef up his toy collection, but because he couldn't wait to give them away to his little sister. In his mind, she needed them more.\n\nIn that moment, I knew that I had to do more. I had to give in any way that I could. I had to be an advocate for children. \n\nBecause of Advocates, and that sweet little boy, I learned the value in giving my time and my talents to bring awareness to child abuse and neglect. I now take pride in meeting new people and sharing with them all of the ways that they can make a positive difference in their community. I continue on each day, hoping that one day I can inspire good actions in others. \n\nMany people equate giving with writing huge checks to charities. Financial contributions are absolutely essential when it comes to allowing organizations to continue their great work, but giving time by way of volunteering is equally as important. Advocates was the reality check that I needed to understand what my purpose in life was, and it was the catalyst that kick-started my passion for giving. I hope that my giving story will inspire YOU to love, to serve, and to give. ",2,2

Or at least, it should be available to everyone on equal footing. After all, justice in America is a public right—not a private commodity. \n \nWhen I volunteer for Alaska Legal Services, my time is worth more than money: It’s worth greater equity and access to a core branch of our democracy. \n \nAnd you can’t put a price tag on that.

Ali's Angels Foundation INC is very near and dear to my heart. You see, one of my dearest friends lost her daughter and hero Ali Vise whom had Battens Disease 1year and 2 months ago on September 16, 2014. Battens disease is a neurological, degenerative disease for which there is no cure or treatment at this time. Battens disease causes children who are normally developing and reaching milestones to loose those abilities they achieved. It takes their ability to walk, talk, see, eat by mouth, they become wheelchair bound and bed bound and left to live in a vegetative state until they die. They develop seizures that increasingly get worse. These children suffer every minute of everyday just as Ali did, but you see Ali fought this monster with grace. She put on her happy face and showed her ' BIG BRAVE', despite what she was going through. She stole the hearts of 135,000 people just from her Facebook page Ali's Angels. Her mommie Donya Catlett has been doing so many wonderful selfless acts if kindness since Ali's passing. She is in the process of getting a special need park built for our Special needs community so they do not have to sit back on the sidelines and feel left out due to a disability. Ali is Donyas hero and Donya is doing her best to keep Ali's memory and legacy alive.

From early childhood to my late teens, my limited wardrobe consisted of either donations from charities or clothes that my mother, who had left her home country of Vietnam during the war, would sew for me.  I learned very early on to find joy in the simple things in life and have always believed, maybe naively so, that people are intrinsically good.  \n\nIt is those humble beginnings that paved the way for my passion for volunteering.  People have helped me and my family when I was younger, and I am now in a position to help others.  Life comes full circle.  Like many, I’ve experienced hardship and painful episodes of loss over the years, but volunteering has always put things in perspective for me.  Such is the beauty of giving: the realization that in the end, the intangibles one receives go way beyond what one gives. \n\nI never had the flexibility to take a year off to travel or to join projects for months on end like some of my fellow volunteers.  I had to start working as soon as I graduated from school but I held on to the idea of giving back, and when there is a will there is a way!  I recently celebrated 20 years of volunteering activities around the world, from orphanage visits to tutoring of underprivileged children, disaster relief or work in slum areas.  \n\nWhile helping out in Japan after the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster of March 2011, a friend told me about an organization called All Hands Volunteers (AHV).  I bookmarked the website. When AHV launched its response to Superstorm Sandy I expressed my interest and soon received an e-mail welcoming me to Project Long Island.  I first joined the project in March 2013 and volunteered with AHV in New York on a total of nine different occasions that year alone.\nThe camaraderie with fellow volunteers coming from all walks of life but with a similar desire to help was instant and infectious.  Logistics were made easy, allowing me to focus my limited time off work on helping rather than untangling administrative details.  I had no technical knowledge but the projects were structured and I was provided with the guidance, safety measures, procedures and tools I needed.  I witnessed first-hand the long-term impact of AHV’s work as several disaster response projects I joined turned into rebuild activities – in New York specifically, I was given a chance to further the response work I had started in early 2013 and help rebuild homes affected by Superstorm Sandy in Long Island in late 2013, Staten Island in 2014 and Brooklyn in 2015.\n\nIt has been two and a half years since my first AHV project. All Hands Volunteers has made it possible for me to volunteer around the world on 14 different projects to address the needs of areas struck by tornadoes, floods, typhoons and earthquakes.   I've learned a lot, made lifetime friends, and still receive occasional updates from survivors I’ve assisted.  \n\nI do not have the energy of a 20-year-old; I do not have much free time beyond weekends and vacation days; I do not have the technical know-how of a construction worker or any specialized skills outside of my office desk work; I do not have big muscles; but I have heart and a strong desire to help, and AHV determined that it was good enough.  They made it possible for me to make a difference.  I am thankful.\n",1,2

In so doing, I have discovered the essence of productive environments for advancement as intentional, innovative, and inviting. \n\nAnd I believe these same ideas might be applied to our collective work in the philanthropic sector. John W. Gardner, former Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare under Lyndon B Johnson, founder of Independent Sector, and 1964 recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, suggests that innovative organizations need a “Department of Continuous Renewal” in order to systematically drive internal (and external) renewal, creativity, and a free flow of ideas. \n\nWhen I envision Gardner’s charge to us, I imagine the ebb and flow of water, an organization in constant motion that demands adapting to the external environment. To this end, we will be embarking on a new train-the-trainer model that will deliver hands-on educational experiences focused on philanthropy, civic engagement, global citizenship, social enterprise, and leadership development more deeply in Chicago area schools. \n\nI give on behalf of the next generations we impact both in our own backyard and around the world. Today, our AfG family walks alongside us on this journey, and we are indeed grateful. Our community empowers us collectively to achieve greater impact.

Sure, everyone says that about their grandfather, and everyone believes it. But I think my Papa had a pretty strong case. He built houses. He built cars. He was the Head of Design Staff at GM. He was a Naval Aviator. He held multiple college degrees. If there was ever a problem, he was the guy you wanted to fix it. If he didn’t have the solution, he could damn sure build one.\n\nWhich made it all the more painful to see Alzheimer’s disease take it all away. It started innocuously enough – forgetting a detail here, retelling a story there. It was easy to write off as old age, even for someone as sharp as he was. But then the big things began to disappear. Names. Places. Faces. Relationships. Nothing can prepare you for the experience of a loved one forgetting who you are – or forgetting who they are.\n\nBack then, my family didn’t know much about Alzheimer’s disease. We didn’t know about the Alzheimer’s Association. But we were lucky to have a supportive family who could help my grandmother provide care. Many don’t have that luxury. That’s why the care, support, research, and education programs of the Alzheimer’s Association are so important. With their help, no family has to face this terrible disease alone. And that’s why we work so hard to support their efforts.\n\nBecause Alzheimer’s disease is the 6th leading cause of death in the United States. Because every 68 seconds someone else is diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Because there is currently no cure or prevention for Alzheimer’s disease. Because, shockingly, only 45% of people with Alzheimer’s disease or their caregivers report being told their diagnosis.\n\nAfter my Grandfather passed, my family began to participate in Alzheimer’s Association fundraisers. We have joined in their fundraiser walks for 10 years, raising and donating nearly $25,000 in two states as a family since our first in 2005. For two years, we organized our own charity golf tournament, raising an additional $5,000. This money helps fund groundbreaking research for prevention, treatments, and cures, care and support programs for people with Alzheimer’s and their caregivers, and educational resources that can make the diagnosis and caregiving processes less frightening for those who go through them.\n\nIn 2013, I was able to take the next step in supporting the Alzheimer’s Association, by helping found the Young Professional Alzheimer’s Advocates of Lansing (YPAAL), a group of young people dedicated to serving our community by raising awareness and providing support for Alzheimer's Association programs, services, events and families affected by this disease. In the almost three years that YPAAL has existed, we have raised over $15,000 for our chapter of the Alzheimer’s Association and performed more than 150 hours of volunteer service to the community. And we’re just getting started.\n\nSome wonder why young people would commit their time, energy, and passion so fully to this cause. But if you take the time to speak to our members, you will understand. We know how devastating this disease is. We know how important these resources are. I urge you to join us in this cause as we do everything we can to end Alzheimer’s once and for all.\n\nThe Alzheimer’s Association’s website is at http://alz.org\nThe Michigan Great Lakes Chapter of the Alzheimer’s Association is at http://alz.org/mglc/\nThe Young Professional Alzheimer’s Advocates of Lansing are at http://www.alz.org/mglc/in_my_community_64035.asp",1,2

It is the largest national day of giving, and every year it falls on the Tuesday following Black Friday and Cyber Monday.\n\nTo give you some perspective, consumers spent $52,405,000,000 on Black Friday and $2,038,000,000 on Cyber Monday last year, according to Statistic Brain. By contrast, donors gave $45,680,000 on Giving Tuesday 2014. That’s just .087% of what consumers spent on Black Friday. Although it is a relatively small amount, it is huge for the charities that rely on our generosity to end suffering.\n\nGiving does mean donating to your favorite charities, yes, but it also means giving of yourself to others by trying to make someone’s life just a little bit better that day. For me, it’s not Thanksgiving or the memory of the annual pilgrimage my grandmother and I used to take to Nordstrom for a new pair of shoes every year on Black Friday that kick off the holiday spirit  – it’s Giving Tuesday.\n\nThis year I plan to donate to America for Animals, because their focus on making activism fun, easy, and fulfilling is what I know will inspire people to use their most powerful built-in tool for creating change – their voice. I care deeply about reducing suffering, and sadly, animals are the most abused. I’ve been an animal activist and a philanthropist for 10 years, and I’m constantly searching for the best approach to inspire new advocates. The more voices the animals have, the more those big corporations that abuse them will listen. By putting the power to change the world in the palm of your hand through innovative apps, connecting motivated people with lifesaving organizations, and changing the message to that of positive inspiration, AFA is empowering new advocates to use their voices to create systemic change to end abuse at its source. I know my Giving Tuesday gift will make a difference, and hopefully, just maybe, inspire someone to speak up for the very first time.\n\nIn honor of my grandmother and our post-Thanksgiving tradition, I also plan to gather up all of my shoes that I no longer wear and donate them to people who need them. I have a tendency to hold on to things way past their prime (these will come back in style one day, right?!), so if the spirit of giving isn’t a good enough excuse to do some closet cleansing, then I don’t know what is!\n\nSo I love Giving Tuesday because it really forces me to step outside of my busy life and reflect on why I give to others, which organizations create the most widespread change, and what I can do that day to give something good to someone else. As a bonus, I feel happier after giving to others instead of myself (and I’m not alone). That’s what December 1st means to me this year.",2,1

The purpose of Angel Flight West is to provide expense-free flights to deserving people in need of transportation for humanitarian reasons. The reasons vary, although they often involve travel for medical needs. Although the AFW pilots are all volunteers who pay for the operation of their airplanes, AFW provides the logistical support, which requires full time (and I dare say, underpaid) employees to do all of the arranging of flights, rented office space in which to work, and the usual expenses of maintaining an office. \n\nWhen I first joined AFW, I did not realize how much I would get back in the joy of providing the flights. The easiest way to describe that feeling is to describe 3 of the flights, each very different from the others.\n\nShortly after Hurricane Katrina, I volunteered to fly to Killeen, TX, to pick up a teenage girl and her dog. She had been visiting a relative in Killeen when the hurricane hit her family’s home in New Orleans, and her family had been air-evac’d from New Orleans to Denver. My purpose was to reunite the family. So I flew to Killeen from Fort Collins, picked up my passenger and her dog and the usual amazing stack of stuff that teenagers think they must have to live, stuffed everything into my little airplane, and flew back to Denver. It was a long flight with a stop going and coming for fuel, so although I’d left early in the morning, we didn’t arrive in Denver until well after dark. We were greeted by her mom and 4 siblings, and the excitement of the kids plus the hugs from my passenger and her mom made it all worthwhile. I arrived back in Fort Collins at 11 p.m. after being in the air a total of more than 11 hours that day.\n\nI picked up my passengers, Gramma, Mom, and 2 year old baby girl, in Scottsbluff, NE, as the second leg of their trip from Iowa City, IA, to Casper, WY. The baby girl was receiving treatment for club feet at the University of Iowa hospital. This was the second time I’d transported this same family, so we all knew what to expect from each other. However, only 2 days before their trip and while they were in Iowa City, an Angel Flight from the east coast had crashed on take off from Iowa City, so my passengers were understandably somewhat nervous. It also happened that a cold front was moving through and was located just east of Casper, so that we had to fly through it and dodge some accompanying scattered thunderstorms. So the ride was bumpy, and the landing at Casper was with an extreme crosswind. Although I warned my passengers that the landing might be a bit rough due to the wind, it was actually very smooth; taxiing in the 40-45 knot wind was more difficult. Once again, I was rewarded with big hugs from all 3 of my passengers, and Gramma punctuated her hug by saying, “I feel so safe, flying with you.”\n\nI picked up my passengers, Mom, Dad, and their 3 year old son, in Denver. The little boy had just gotten a clean bill of health after months of cancer treatment, so the parents were understandably elated and in wonderful spirits. The original plan was just to fly them to Casper and have another AFWer fly them on to Billings, MT, the nearest large airport to their home in Hardin, MT. But I volunteered to take both legs. Poor Mom had a very tender tummy, so she got sick several times during the trip. We stopped for lunch and fuel in Casper, and then flew on toward Billings. But as Dad and I were chatting, I asked if they had left a car in Billings, but they hadn’t—a relative was going to drive up from Hardin to get them. I asked if he knew of any problem with the Hardin airport, and all he knew was that it was very small, but it was only 4 blocks from their home. So instead of going to Billings, I diverted to Hardin. It was indeed a small airstrip, but so much more convenient to their home. And again, I was rewarded by big hugs from both parents and from their little boy.\n\nI have done volunteer work with different agencies throughout my life, but the personal gratification I have had from flying AFW flights has been greater than any other of the volunteering I have done.

Through watching her example, I learned that even people with so little money can make such a difference for people in need through giving things like compassion, time, understanding and so much more.\n\nOver the years, I came to learn for myself that life is really all about circumstance and luck - luck as to where you are born, when you are born, what family or gender or ethnicity or state of health or economic level you are born into, and so on.

After now years later being involved with many different nonprofits, I have come to value the work of the hospital even more for not only do they provide Cambodian children with quality health care regardless of their family's ability to pay, but they are focusing so much of their efforts on rebuilding the national healthcare system since its demise under the Khmer Rouge. And just this year, they handed over the reigns of the hospital to its first ever Cambodian Medical Executive Director. It continues to be a world class nonprofit children's hospital that I couldn't be more proud to support and confident that every dollar they receive is spent wisely with treating all Cambodian children as their top priority.\n",3,3

Anike Foundation is a community of people who share a common belief that abundant resources in the developed world, channeled appropriately, could alleviate the problem of illiteracy in Africa. Our core mission is to promote educational development in Africa by gathering educational resources from developed nations and distributing them to needy institutions in Africa. We do this by forming partnerships with nonprofit organizations and educational institutions whose mission and objectives are aligned with ours.\n\nOn one occasion, we asked one of our partner organizations, an elementary school in Uganda, what resources we could provide to them to meet their education needs. They answered in no uncertain terms that their most dire need at the time was a latrine or toilet facility for the school children. Although this request did not fall directly under what we defined as 'educational resources,' we proceeded to raise funds to build a toilet facility for the school. A latrine was erected a year later, thereby alleviating rather harrowing conditions under which these school children were learning. This experience taught me that we cannot promote educational development without attending to the most basic needs of the pupils we are trying to help. While ministering to their educational resources, we must keep in our peripheral vision the conditions under which they are studying and take steps to address them as needed.",2,3

I created it 20 years ago, after my father died, when my sister and I were left the responsibility of running his charitable foundation. I wanted to do something meaningful but also personal with my good fortune. Fine as they were, I did not want to rubber stamp existing programs; I wanted to create my own.\n\nBeing a woman artist, I knew (and continue to know) how difficult it is for women to get the same recognition in the art world as their male counterparts. The program started on the heels of financial cutbacks for individual artist grants from the National Endowment for the Arts. This, coupled with Virginia Wolf’s essay ‘A Room of One’s Own’ was the driving force behind the award.\n\nThe program made its first awards in 1996 and continues today. Each year, ten women artists receive grants of $25,000 each. They can use the funds however they please, and the only requirement is that at the end of the year, they write us a letter telling us how the award impacted their life. So far, some 200 women artists have received the grants for a total of $5 million in awards.\n\nI wanted to remain anonymous because true giving should not be rewarded by recognition. Candidates are nominated anonymously by previous winners and by women professionals in the arts.  Winners are selected by a panel of prominent judges who also remain anonymous. The guidelines haven’t changed in the twenty years since the program began. We have a website, but no money goes toward public relations, exhibitions or parties.  Only the administrator is known to the nominators, panelists, candidates and winners.\n\nMy inspiration remains the same today as it did twenty years ago – only perhaps stronger. There is still an enormous need to help women artists. I am very proud of this program and that is recognition enough!\n\nNote:  this essay was written by Anonymous Donor and is submitted on her behalf by Administrator, Anonymous Was A Woman.\n\n\n\n",2,4

She spoke regularly and with great passion wanting the youth of this generations to meet her, learn of the truth she saw, and draw lessons about how we treat the 'Other' in our own spheres.  She was smart, committed, self aware and wonderful with young people.  We had her speak a lot.

She sheepishly asked for a private meeting with me and I was thrilled to have another chance to talk with her on any subject.\n   She began to tell me of how much it means to her that we were working to preserve the memories of those lost in the Holocaust, how deeply it moved her to be part of sharing the truth of her specific story to help young people understand the way hatred can grow out of control and the deep connection she felt to the work.\n   She then slowly reached into her blouse and produced a check.   She handed me the check and began to weep.  She told me that her biggest regret in life was that she was not able to make a transformative gift to support this work.\n   I did not even look at the amount on the check, held her hand and weeping with her told her how deeply touched I was by her gesture.  I assured her of my gratitude for her support both financially and with her very soul and had to opportunity once again to tell her of my admiration and deep love of her and her character in seeking to be a change agent.\n  She held my hand as she regained her composure and looked me deep in the eyes.  'Keep doing what you are doing', she almost sighed, 'It is very important we teach the children how to treat each other.  It is vital what we do here.'\n   I have never forgotten that moment.  It was deeply rewarding to get reaffirmation of the work, so warm to hear from a person of her stature and wisdom that we were doing the 'right' things and while the check was modest, I knew that she had sacrificed a meal or two in order to afford writing that check.\n\nIt was, and remains, the most meaningful contribution I have ever been involved with.

Even if they can manage to get one pair of shoes, children grow so quickly that they can't afford to replace shoes as they grow.\n\nLinda Freeman and her daughter-in-law Daniella have a goal of providing 600 pairs of 'The Shoe that Grows' which is made to last five years/five sizes to the children of Light of Future School in Cambodia when they visit in 2016. \nThese children have inspired me; their sheer joy at getting an education, at getting even a PENCIL in order to pursue an education, is humbling. \n\nAnd I think a shoe that lasts five years is probably a better cost proposition than a piece of decorated paper; I'm betting the children of Light of Future School will find that to be the case!\nMore about this project from Linda here: \nhttp://iamthriving.org/2015/10/the-shoe-that-grows-in-cambodia/\n\nAnd the 501c3: www.becauseinternational.org\n",2,1

She was a beautiful long hair calico that my daughter and I got from a kid giving them away in front of a grocery store. The little boy was most sincere in his sadness that if he couldn't give the kittens away on that day that his Dad would be taking them to the 'pound'. My daughter and I were compelled to give the little kitten a good home. As she got older I knew we had to get her spayed or we too might have to find homes for baby kittens and there were SO many in need of homes at the Humane  Society already. Getting her spayed was the right thing to do but we didn't have the money to pay the vet. I heard about this new organization, The Bend Spay & Neuter Project, that provided free spay and neuter to those who were low income and that they didn't make you fill out any humiliating paper work or financial forms. If you brought in your pet they would help. It was a great way to both get the kitten spayed and teach my daughter the importance of getting it done before the first litter of kittens came along.  Since then we have had several pets that have received services there including vaccines. We have watched the clinic grow over the years and are so impressed with their success. They have provided almost 45,000 spay and neuter surgeries since they opened. Whenever me or my daughter hear someone say they can't afford to get their animal 'fixed' we always tell them to go the clinic, it's the most affordable place in Central Oregon to go. We can't imagine what it would be like without them in our community. They even have a pet food bank so no dog or cat goes hungry. We help them as much as we can by talking about them and their services, donating cash, and putting their promotional materials in our local donut shop.

My parents divorced when I was 12 and my mother moved away due to my step father's job. I stayed in my hometown with my father but I was lacking that strong female figure in my life. Someone I could talk to like a Big Sister about the trials of life. \n\nMy aunt became that person for me as my mentor, my rock and role model. She was there for every school dance, boyfriend drama and even took me to get my driver's license. I still call her for advice often and when I need to see another point of view in a situation. She has been the best mediator when there are conflicts between me and my parents. I could never repay her for the things she has done for me but that got me thinking, how I can be there for someone like she was there for me?\n\nMy junior year of college, I joined Big Brothers Big Sisters of Central California as a Big Sister. I chose to be matched with Julia, a spunky young 13 year old who had already been on the waiting list due to her last Big dropping the program.

TRUE,1,0,1,42327.3324,207.110.14.226,13-4092050,TRUE,TRUE,10175,"Today, there are over 500,000 young Jewish adults who have participated in a Birthright Israel trip. It’s hard to find someone in America, regardless of religion, who hasn’t heard of Birthright Israel but if you are unaware, Birthright Israel began in 1999 as a simple and what some called crazy idea. A group of Jewish philanthropists came together to solve what they saw as a problem in the Jewish world in the 90s. Diaspora Jews were becoming less and less connected to their Judaism and to Israel, a nation the Jews had fought so hard to establish. The idea was simple – send young Jewish adults on a free, educational, 10-day trip to Israel and in doing so, transform the Jewish future. \n\nToday, Birthright Israel stands as the most influential identity building program of our time, having changed the lives of more than half a million young people since its inception. And that number only counts the young people who have been on the trip, it doesn’t take into account the children who have been raised in Jewish homes because their parents went on Birthright, or the 75 year old great-aunt who went to Israel for the first time because after her nieces’ Birthright Israel trip. \n\nIt is undeniable that Birthright Israel is life-changing. Each story of Birthright Israel’s 500,000 alumni is unique and different, but they are all equally as impactful. For some, Israel was their first taste of Judaism, others may have felt disconnected until going on the trip. \n\nAnd then, there are those of us who were raised in strong Jewish communities like mine, attended Hebrew school twice a week, and celebrated the high holidays with our families. But, the best part about Birthright Israel is that it finds a way to touch everyone, and a way to be life-changing, no matter your background.\n\nI first traveled to Israel on Birthright Israel in January of 2014, during my senior year of college. I hugged my parents goodbye, and nervously boarded the plane with little expectations. A free ten-day trip, an excuse to get out of the frigid East Coast winter, and maybe an opportunity to meet a cute Israeli soldier. Less than two weeks later, I understood why Birthright insists on calling the trip a gift.\n\nIn ten days, I fell in love. I fell in love with people, with places, with Judaism, and with Israel. I did not return home in a floor length skirt and shomer negiah, nor with the intention of making aliyah or joining the IDF. Though noble, Birthright did not lead me down those paths. But, I did return home intending to go back and to make Israel part of my life in America, though I wasn’t exactly sure how. \n\nI jumped on the first chance I got and returned to Israel five months later to staff a Birthright Israel trip. As cliché as it sounds, the moment I stepped out of Ben Gurion airport, I felt at home. I was filled with joy as I watched my 40 participants embrace Israel, many of them for the very first time.\n\nThe mood during my second trip to Israel was different than my first. It was more emotional, raw, and challenging, yet rewarding. I felt an unfamiliar sense of urgency as our trip ended just days before the bodies of Naftali Fraenkel, Gilad Shaer and Eyal Yifrah were found. It seemed crucial that these 40 young Jewish adults, along with the 3,000 plus participants who were in Israel at the time, get the absolute most out of these ten days.\n\nAt the age of twenty-two, twenty days in Israel taught me almost as much as four years at a high-ranking university. Twenty days in Israel taught me what real diversity is, what it truly means to be part of something bigger than myself, to be a more informed global citizen, and most importantly, to be grateful for the life I was born into.\n\nI learned that being Jewish extends far beyond the camp-going, Lululemon-wearing, Starbucks-drinking stereotype that marks the East Coast. I learned that even in Israel, no two Jews share the same story as Judaism reaches every corner of the globe.\n\nI learned that no matter how you define your observance, Judaism is not only a religion, but a culture and a way of life. I learned that although I was not born in Israel, do not hold an Israeli passport or have any biological family in Israel, it was still my home. Throughout my first trip, I heard this sentiment countless times. At a kibbutz on the Lebanon boarder, from a former government worker, on Shabbat at the Western Wall. It was not until my very last day that I understood the truth of this statement when a stranger told me, “Make sure you come back soon. You know this is your home.”\n\nAnd that was the moment it all clicked for me. I had never thought of Judaism as something intrinsically tied to Israel. Israel had always been an abstract concept in my mind, but Birthright made me realize just how important Israel is to me and Judaism as a whole. \n\nA month after returning home from my second trip to Israel, I found a way to make Israel a part of my everyday life. I was presented with the amazing opportunity to work full time, for the Birthright Israel Foundation, the organization that is tasked with raising millions of dollars each year, so that thousands of young Jewish adults can go on Birthright Israel and find their unique place in the Jewish story. \n\nI never envisioned working for non-profit, let alone a Jewish non-profit, after graduation. I always saw myself using my writing skills at a glamorous magazine, where I would spend my days buried in lipstick and sequins.  But what I’m doing now is so much more rewarding than that. \n\nI’d love to be in a place where I could personally donate enough ($3,000) each year to send one young Jewish adult on Birthright, but I can’t. Instead, I give pour my heart and soul (and sometime tears) into this organization, Birthright Israel Foundation, each and every day. I’m honored to be a fraction of the reason that the Jewish future is so bright. \n\nwww.birthrightisrael.foundation  \n",3,3

These people need food, clothes, friendship, and someone to look them in the eye. Blessings Under the Bridge provides for all of those needs. \n\nFor my youngest daughter Adeline's 6th birthday, she originally wanted to drive around handing out money to homeless people. Later, she decided she wanted to have her birthday party at Blessings Under the Bridge so she and her friends could help more people. She made plans to do that with her best friend Violet, but those plans were put on hold when Violet, who suffers a number of health issues, had to be hospitalized in March.  \n\nBefore Violet’s surgery, Adeline and I set up an online fundraiser for Blessings Under the Bridge. The plan was to help Violet feel better knowing that, while she was in the hospital, they would be raising money to help. She would have something to look forward to when she was well again. Plus the girls could continue their plan even though it couldn’t be in time for Adeline’s birthday. \n\nThanks to donors from all over, Adeline’s tzedakah bank, and Violet’s own money that she donated, the girls far surpassed their goal and were able to donate over $1700. \n\nTheir volunteer time at Blessings Under the Bridge has been amazing. First off, this is one of the only local organizations that values and encourages the effort of children. Many organizations only want volunteers over 12 or 16 or 18. Blessings Under the Bridge has something for children of all ages to do. And they really do help out. They don’t simply stand and look cute. They serve sweets or drinks. They’re real contributing members. So everyone at Blessings Under the Bridge welcomed the girls with open arms (literally). Though they were young, these girls weren’t a nuisance. They were loved and celebrated. Everyone made it very clear that they appreciated all the work the girls had done both in raising money and in coming out to help.  When they found out Violet had donated the money she planned to spend at the American Girl doll store, the folks at Blessings Under the Bridge took a collection and gave the girls some money so they could still do that. \n\nThe girls served donuts that day. They did so with huge smiles. They were so happy to help. Blessings Under the Bridge gave them a way to help, saw the value in their effort, and encouraged them to continue. \n\nSince that day, both girls have continued to help at Blessings Under the Bridge. Sometimes they go together. Sometimes they go with their families. Over the summer, inspired by Adeline’s love of the organization and the way everyone there had treated her so warmly, Adeline’s elderly grandparents insisted on going to volunteer too. Violet and Adeline are always greeted with smiles. Knowing that they are loved and that they are helping, the girls have continued to fundraise and buy supplies. They have donated flip-flops, toiletries, clothes, shoes, toys, and so much more. Jessica Kovac, one of the founders asked the girls to be a part of their 8th anniversary. So the girls baked hundreds of cupcakes and helped serve them. They had a blast and helped so many.\n\nThe girls not only know they’re appreciated, but through volunteering with Blessings Under the Bridge, they learn to appreciate others—both those who need help and those providing it. The girls adore founders Jessica and Mike Kovac. We all see how hard they work and what a difference they’re making. The girls also see the value in people in those lines. To so many, those who are homeless are seen as useless. One time, Jessica told the volunteers to make sure we look each person in the eye. She said that, for many, those Wednesday night feeds are the only time someone will be willing to do that. They spend all week feeling invisible or worthless, but they know their Wednesday nights at Blessings Under the Bridge mean not only a warm meal, but also being treated like a human being. We hand the food to everyone. We serve them. We talk to them. We’re respectful to them. We laugh with them. We treat them well because they deserve it. Blessings Under the Bridge helps the children see that when so many adults cannot. \n\nBlessings Under the Bridge has helped our whole family see the needs of and value in Spokane’s homeless. ",2,2

Some may call these moments happiness. Other times, moments bring you face to face with fear and for some of us that means death. Those who experience a traumatic experience have a hard time detaching the emotion from a memory such as this. From the moment a traumatic incident happens, a haunting voice tells you ”you shouldn't have survived”. The memories constantly bring up feelings of terror, fear, anger and sadness. You are tied to the constructs of the mind, and if you are constantly in a state of fear or anger or sadness, you never let those emotions subside. A black cloud hovers over you waiting to take your life, if you don't make the decision first. When forced to face death, a new perspective on life is born. \n\nAt 17 years of age, I was involved in a traumatic car accident. Six hours after the time of the accident, I finally received medical help. I was rushed to the nearest trauma center and quickly accessed for injuries. After x-rays and recovering my temperature from hypothermic levels, the doctor announced I needed emergency surgery. The nurses brought my loved ones into the room, and told them to say their goodbyes, they were not sure if I would survive the procedure. In this moment, I looked death straight in the face and went under anesthesia not knowing if I would wake up.\n\nComing into adulthood with a traumatic experience like this, lead me spiraling downward, doubting my existence. “Why did I survive?!”, I would constantly question. I truly did not believe I deserved the second chance I was afforded. Psychologists put me on antidepressants, which took a year of my life. The chemical shift in my brain chemistry made me numb, numb to one of the most basic human experiences, emotion. This numbness perpetuated into everything I did.\n\nIt was time to find a new medicine, so I left the pharmaceuticals behind and began to explore my consciousness.\n  \nWith the help of Blue Morpho, I was able to take this experience and let it ignite my passion for life rather than perpetuate my fear of living. I was able to see clearly the simple shift in conscious awareness of the emotions I experienced, separating my memory from the reality of the present moment. Instead of wondering why I survived, doubting my second chance, I now see my place in the world as a vital part of this existence. I can see the moment I almost left the world, as a significant impact on the loved ones around me. All the apparent tragedy in that hospital room was actually filled with copious amounts of love.\n\nHamilton Souther and Blue Morpho Foundation opened up the hood of my brain and tinkered with the igniter and the starter and reprogrammed them so I realize, I am the one actually doing the tuning up. Humans were blessed with so much power: choice, free will, conscious awareness, mindful knowledge and emotional intelligence, so why not utilize these tools in balance with one another to navigate through this reality. With a simple change in perspective, a technique I learned through my work with Blue Morpho, I finally understood, that I had a choice. A choice to let my emotions overwhelm me, or to take control back and use the other tools I have in my back pocket.\n\nNow, I love myself fully, no one can ever take that from me, and my relationship with myself is the most important relationship to foster and care for. When you love yourself, the memories, the shame and all the judgments melt away. Stillness and peace infiltrate the mind, body and soul. Without Blue Morpho, I would not be following my passions in life. I would have been sucked in the dark whole of mental illness that American society is so quick to compartmentalize trauma sufferers into. \n\nThat is why I give – because I found a nonprofit that truly changes lives.

He couldn't pass a shopping cart, scooter, bike or shopping cart without trying to push it and ride it as fast as he possibly could. He was mostly non-verbal but he could say 'car', 'wheel', 'go fast' before he could say anything else.\n\nThe first four years of his life mainly consisted of my husband and I trying to keep him from seriously hurting himself. We started him with ice skating right away (we are Canadian and both came from a hockey background). Wesley loved the speed of skating and was instantly the best skater at the rink. He liked hockey but rarely appeared to look forward to doing it. \n\nWhat Wesley LOVED was watching the MTV show 'Rob and Big'. We realized that when he watched the show, he would jump around the living room pretending to do all of the skate tricks. He memorized all the dialogue and begged for a skateboard.\n\nWe got Wesley his first real skateboard for his 5th birthday. Instantly, his vocabulary blossomed, his coordination was outstanding, he looked more comfortable on a skateboard than walking on the ground. He was the happiest kid on planet earth.\n\nHours every day were spent in our driveway or in our garage when it was raining. It didn't matter if it was hot or cold, he would loose himself in his skating. Seeing your kids become passionate about something at such an early age is an amazing thing for a parent. Hockey fell off the schedule and skateboarding became his life!\n\nOver the next 5 years, driveway skating was enhanced by trips to skateparks all over the United States. Some of the parks felt dangerous and some of the skaters looked rough but I was devoted to tour as many parks as I could with my son. As a mom, I quickly learned that skate culture is one of acceptance and skaters taking care of skaters. The older sponsored kids would often give their 'old' wheels to the younger groms. Outgrown skate-company shirts were passed on to other skaters who could fit into them. Gas station snacks were always shared. Trick tips were exchanged. Filmers shared their talents. \n\nTwo years ago, we moved to Tampa, Florida. My son began to 'live' at the Skatepark of Tampa and once again, we were welcomed with open arms and we all quickly made new friends thanks to SPoT. One day, I saw a poster advertising an upcoming 'Boards for Bros Build Day'. Our whole family attended and helped build over 200 skateboards to give out to underserved youth in Tampa at Christmas. It was absolutely thrilling to know that the boards I was helping put together might end up in the hands of another kid like my son Wesley! No matter who raw my fingers got that day working the bearing press, I was fully motivated to assemble as many boards as humanly possible.\n\nThree weeks later, I went along for the ride while we gave away the boards we worked so hard assembling. Skaters dressed as Santa, got up early in the morning and we hit the streets giving boards and skate lessons to over 200 kids. Boys and girls couldn't believe that they could keep their boards! Kids cried they were so happy! Moms came running out of their apartments and hugged the volunteers with thanks. I saw so many kids skate away (some not even wearing shoes) with the same twinkle in my eye that I saw in my son when I bought him his first skateboard.\n\nThat day I became fully committed to ensure that skateboarding is accessible to ALL youth regardless of their economic situation. Skateboarding is a tool that teaches perseverance, promotes exercise and provides an outlet for personal expression. Free skateboards allows parents to give their child a toy to occupy their time, keep them safe, keep them busy and develop a happy sense of self.\n\nMy son Wesley is now 14 years old and he devotes his spare time to volunteering with Boards for Bros! This awesome organization not only helps skaters get their first boards, but it engages current skaters in community service! Skaters helping future skaters. Skaters feeling that they can make a difference in their neighborhoods and communities. Skaters feeling like they have something important to contribute to society.\n\nBoards for Bros truly changes lives, one skateboard at a time.

They live in a teen parent shelter in the Boston area. I have known the youth since she was 14 and had just run away from an abusive home. Initially I advocated for her in court as she was involved with the child welfare system due to the abuse. Our relationship has evolved to the point where she trusts me, knows that I am here for her and her daughter, and believes me when I tell her that she can accomplish whatever she wants to in life. She aged out of the foster care system last summer and is on her way to taking the GED tests and has aspirations to be a nurse midwife. Every child who goes through abuse and neglect deserves a caring adult who consistently shows up, advocates for them and is kind of their back-up system.  When I visited her at the teen parent shelter recently, I met some of the other girls and their children. I realized that they all deserve to be treated with respect and kindness. I decided to create a pop-up shop/salon experience for them in early December where they can choose some outfits, get their nails and hair done and have a nice meal. I have rounded up quite a few volunteers to help me with this, a local salon has offered to do the treatments and my home is being inundated with beautiful teen clothing! My own 14 year old daughter is enjoying helping me sort, launder and press the clothing. This work gives me immense joy and satisfaction. I give to Boston CASA on a consistent monthly basis and appreciate all they have done to train and support me as I continue on this journey to advocate for disenfranchised youth. The model makes sense. Every single child who has been abused or neglected deserves a caring adult by their side. That is what Boston CASA does. \n\n",2,4

My parents drove my siblings and I down to a part of town where we rarely went. It was dark, the heavy dark of winter, and it was cold. I may have been a bit cranky because I was forced to wear tights and dress shoes, anticipating some “grown-up” event where I would have to sit still.\n\n       We entered a building and wound our way to a gym. Bleachers lined the walls of the basketball court make-shift auditorium; someone was handing out plastic mesh stockings that contained oranges, apples and candy canes. I looked around and saw children and parents holding the stockings around me. I fidgeted with my dress, uninterested in the talking that was going on below.\n\n        Suddenly, there was a commotion. Chatter in waves filled the gym. I listened closely and heard the speaker say that one lucky member was about to win a bike. A shiny BMX bike was wheeled into the center of the gym. Anticipation mounted. Children leaned forward on the worn wooden bleachers, scooting to the edge of their seat. A name was called.\n\n        My memory fades remembering the boy in the red sweatshirt with worn jeans bolting to the floor to claim his prize; hands shaking as he grasped his special, shiny, brand new bike. He didn’t have to dress up. I wondered if Santa would bring me a new bike too.\n\n        Years later, I realized the significance of that night. I had attended the Christmas celebration at our local Boys Club, now known as the Boys & Girls Clubs of the Chattahoochee Valley. The children there that night, came from one of our more impoverished neighborhoods. The stockings full of fruits and a few sweets were probably the only treats they would receive during the holiday season. The boy who won the bike, he may as well have been Charlie winning a golden ticket; he hit the jackpot. That night was his visit from Santa.\n\n        Years later, I’m a third generation Board Member with our local clubs. My grandmother and father before me taught me about the importance of each of our Boys & Girls Clubs in the development of leadership, health, and success of the youth in our community. After years of watching my grandmother sell daisies as a fundraiser, and my father serve time as President of the Board,  I went on to get my first real job working in the administrative office. I was responsible for calling donors to sponsor a golf tournament to benefit the programs at the clubs. I discovered how much those dollars stretched to provide a safe haven and to give children coming to after school and summer programs some well-rounded extracurricular activities - after homework of course!\n\n       As a college student, I returned with classmates to complete service projects in the J. Barnett Woodruff Club to showcase what the kids were learning. I saw first hand how much the staff loved those kids; how important it was to keep the teenagers on track. Most stunning, was we heard it from the kids too. Recent local Youth of the Year winner N’Zier Bohannon, spoke to us at our Women’s Giving Circle Luncheon and told attendees that the Clubs and their staff were responsible for sending him to college. He lamented that his younger brother didn’t come to the clubs, didn’t follow his path ,and was not able to benefit from the same opportunities he did. Misty eyed, he thanked every one in the room for supporting the clubs because it meant we were making a difference in the lives of children like him.\n\n        I don’t have one single time that supporting a non-profit meant something to me; My Giving Story is about one organization that has my heart. The Boys & Girls Clubs of the Chattahoochee Valley have inspired joy, hope, and dreams of a successful future in the lives of children that may have otherwise been derailed. In my opinion, the best way to positively influence our community is to raise up our children, and our local Boys & Girls Clubs do just that.",3,2

I relearned how to walk, see a world with double vision and I am just now back in graduate school getting my MFA. I’m teaching creative writing at a jail, working as a dishwasher and writing my memoir about my ABI. I attend walks to support my fellow survivors, fighters and new friends.  In August I attended the BIANYS walk over the Hudson, which was an event close to home. I lead Team Walnut over the bridge, raised money and even had two little dogs in attendance. I met and made a new friend also named Lisa; we shared a tired moment on the end of the long bridge.

I know what it feels like to fight for life and the ability to do even the little things like pick up a carton of milk, or use a fork and knife.

For our youngest, that passion was ballet.\n\nBrandywine Ballet was my daughter's home away from home.  Day after day in classes and weekend after weekend of rehearsals.  We got our first glimpse of what had 'called' to her when we saw BBC's 2005 production of The Nutcracker.  It was BIG.  This wasn't just cute kids on a stage at recital.  This was real ballet.  And it was magical.\n\nWe watched our daughter become an incredible dancer because of the training of the artistic staff and the experience of being on stage in those memorable productions.

The first thing I noticed and liked about C.H.A.N.G.E was that everyone was welcome, regardless of financial status, fitness level or age. And, everyone at C.H.A.N.G.E is a volunteer, from Carmalee Foster, C.H.A.N.G.E 's Founder/Program Director, to the team of Zumba Instructors to the Maintenance Manager. Relationships and friendships are formed and it truly is a Zumba Family! \nI saw what C.H.A.N.G.E brought to our community and the difference it was making. I had to lend my expertise in some way. I needed to be a part of that and help Carmalee develop, expand and improve her vision. I really wasn't asked to volunteer nor did I really ask to help. It just sort of happened.  Together, we started addressing and organizing small things behind the scenes. This led to us collaborating on different marketing ideas, including event planning, merchandising, fund-raising, and grant writing. Thankfully, it has helped us build on, increase and improve what Carmalee had developed and done for 3 years. \nWe have many, many great ideas and goals for C.H.A.N.G.E.’s future! One of the biggest is to create and develop an Afterschool Fitness and Nutrition Program for our community’s children. I am even looking into reinstating my Personal Training Certification and obtaining the other necessary certifications to run this program!\nAnother one of my favorite quotes says: \n'Working hard for something we don't care about is called stress. \nWorking hard for something we love is called passion.” - Simon Sinek\nI work hard for C.H.A.N.G.E. I dedicate a lot of my time and effort into C.H.A.N.G.E. And, I love it! \nI am passionate about making a difference and I am passionate about helping create C.H.A.N.G.E. in our community! \nC.H.A.N.G.E is happening and I am blessed to be a part of it! \n",3,2

Cameron was born in 2006, two months premature, with a host of life long medical conditions, most notably Hydrocephalus. As we cared for our special little boy, the medical bills began to mount. In 2010, our family was provided with financial support from family and friends to assist in paying down this huge medical debt. Because of this assistance, Cameron can be the happy third grader that he is and is not defined by his ongoing medical conditions! \n\nAs we experienced first-hand how financial support could make such a profound impact on our son’s life, we made it our mission to pay it forward and to help other children with life-long neurological conditions. Therefore, in 2011, we created The Cameron Can Foundation http://www.cameron-can.com. It is our goal to show children all they CAN do by providing their families with quality of life grants. These grants can help pay down medical debt, provide adaptive bikes, additional therapies or life experiences such as a camp geared to children with medical needs.\n\nTo date, The Cameron Can Foundation, a 501(c ) 3 non-profit organization, has raised over $350,000. This has helped 12 children and a variety of institutions that help children on a daily basis, such as Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, YMCA Camp Independence for kids with Spina Bifida and research groups working to find a cure for Hydrocephalus.\n\nThe work that I pour into the Cameron Can Foundation is my life’s passion and the most rewarding way I can give back to a community that gave our family hope and a bright future for our son Cameron.  We are continuing to grow this foundation and hope to help many more children with life-long neurological conditions be all they CAN be!\n",1,2

After everyone was served, we had an option to go out and eat with the community members.  \n\nI wasn't sure why it affected me so much.

So many people have walked away changed, myself included.

To stroke her hair and tell her repeatedly that you love her so much till she calms down. To wipe away her tears and try to hold back your own because your heart is breaking for hers. \n\nTo see campers, counselors, and even staff, cling to a cross and thank God for an amazing week where they were loved and accepted and wish they could stay at camp forever. To lift each other up and pray a blessing on each other. \n\nHow do you put all those emotions into words...I could use words like love, joy, broken, restored...etc. Yet, they feel so generic. I guess the best way to put CBTX into words for someone who has never experienced it before would be 'A little bit of Heaven on Earth'.   \n\nRight now CBTX has a campaign called 'Build a Blessing' where they are trying to raise the money needed to build their own camp. Can you believe they have been a mobile camp for 10 years now!! Everything I said above and much more has happened on so many different camp sites, were we have had to adapt to their grounds and that can be a little challenging with wheelchairs and other equipment needed by our campers. The good news is God has blessed them with property, now they just need to build.\n\nI have supported Camp Blessing Texas financially, prayerfully, and physically. I hope you will choose to help them build a Blessing so many more campers and volunteers will be able to experience Camp Blessing. \n\nTo learn more about Camp Blessing Texas you can visit their site here:  http://campblessing.org/",2,2

Then, suddenly in 1987, I experienced my first 'grand mal seizure' and it was the onset of Epilepsy for me, which changed my life forever. I continued to work for the next fourteen years, until the frequency and severity of my seizures forced me to go out on disability in (2001). This was a profoundly sad moment in my life. \n\nThe scariest part of 'grand mal seizures' is that you never feel them coming on, they strike without warning. You simply collapse, commonly resulting in injury. After regaining consciousness, you don’t know what happened. Thus, Epilepsy easily imprisons people, removing them from the real world. This neurological disorder did it to me, depression set in, and this was an ongoing battle of my life for fourteen years. I had brain surgery performed in (2003) to help reduce the frequency of my seizures, but my Epilepsy continued to control my life. \n\nShortly after that, I was introduced by a friend to a non-profit organization, called: “Canine Partners for Life” (CPL) who raised and trained assistance dogs. It detailed the wonderful work that these dogs do for disabled individuals, such as: retrieving objects that are out of a person’s reach, opening and closing doors on command, turning light switches on and off, providing balance and support, assist bed-dependent individuals to move, assist with dressing and undressing, provide stability on stairs, take purchases and wallets to a cashier, seizure alerts, cardiac alerts, and much more. \n\nOver the past eleven (11) years I have been partnered with “assistance dogs” that have positively changed my life forever.

I have watched my son, Hunter struggle with seizures due to having a stroke when he was 11. Hunter'a life went from being a 'normal' teenager to having uncontrolled seizures with injuries quite often. He was falling a lot and having to get stitches, breaking things, and just being extremely embarrassed of not being able to control his life anymore. It was devestating. We started researching how we could help our son get back to living and enjoying life. We decided to apply to Canine Partners for Life in Cochranville,Pa. \nWww k94life.org \nAll of their dogs are tested to see if they will alert to someone who actually has seizures. This was a big plus in helping us make our decision to choose them. After lots of research, applying, fund raising, and then waiting for that special call, Hunter was finally matched up with his seizure-alert dog, Argos. All I can say is, wow, what a match!! Annie(trainer) decided to put Argos with Hunter because they are both so loving and personable. It was instant love. We spent 3 1/2 weeks at CPL for training so Hunter could learn how to take care of Argos. It was a very intensive, serious, and educational experience. Hunter became Argos' partner for life that summer. The bond they have created in the past year is unbelievable. Argos gives about. 5 min alert before Hunter has a seizure. He runs his face all over Hunter's thighs. Hunter knows he has to pay attention to Argos so he will not get injured. Argos attends 10th grade with Hunter at our local high school. If Argos alerts, they go to a safe place and sit until after the seizure and if help is needed it is given. Hunter has again become the happy boy he used to be. He is confident again, can go outside on his own, goes off with friends now and is becoming more independent thanks to Argos. The great thing about Argos is that CPL trains all their dogs to do about 10 tasks so that they can help their person with daily things. Argos helps Hunter with balance, tugging open doors, picking up and carrying items and other tasks. They are never a part. If Hunter does not feel well he can tell his dog ton'get mom' and Argos will find me so I can help Hunter.

For me, going home to where I 'grew-up' means going to an unassuming, beautiful place hidden in the Blue Ridge Mountains called Caroline Furnace Lutheran Camp. I was a camper there for 7 summers when I was a child. I met my dearest friend there; I met the Holy Spirit there.  I learned how to paddle a canoe, build a fire, and take a shower in under 2 minutes. And there is no place in the world that feels more like home to me. Now my children are campers at Caroline Furnace and a new generation is getting to experience a week of living in the woods, creating masterpieces out of yarn and Popsicle sticks, singing songs about yodeling ostriches and that one tin soldier riding away, and collecting slag.\n\nThe truth is I could probably write a hundred essays about Caroline Furnace, my summers there, and what it means to me. But for the purpose of this contest, I'll limit it to what happened on a Saturday in April, not too long ago. \n\nThis weekend I'm referring to was the annual spring work weekend at camp where volunteers are recruited to do much needed work around the camp grounds and facilities before the busy summer season. I waffled for a few weeks on whether or not we could attend because my midterm for my graduate thesis was due in a few days and I wasn't sure I could really spare any time over the weekend. On Wednesday I said to my husband, 'do you mind if we go to Caroline Furnace on Saturday for work weekend?'  Don't you like how I said 'we'? Of course being the amazing man that he is, he didn't hesitate at all. Even though he was never a camper there, he gets it about Caroline.\n\nSo we decided to go down for just the day. Like good little campers we filled our water bottles, put on our I-don't-care-if-this-gets-dirty clothes and got on the road only slightly later than I intended. I knew from emails and Facebook that several old camp friends of mine would be there, including a friend whom I hadn't actually seen since the last time we were at camp together -- over 20 years ago! As I drove the familiar curves of the back-mountain road a little faster than I should have, I felt my heart quicken with excitement and couldn't help but smile as memories came flooding back. It happens every time.\n\nWhen we arrived, many people were already off doing their assigned morning tasks, since a large number of the volunteers had come up the night before. We were greeted by one of my former counselors, who is now on the camp's Board of Directors and the driving force behind work weekend. After sharing a few hugs we were quickly sent to our assigned areas. The kids got to be on the 'kid brigade', I was put to work helping clean in the kitchen, and my husband was ushered off to help with work being done at the camp director's house. I felt a small twinge of guilt and worry because I knew my husband wouldn't really know anyone and it might be awkward for him. But I silently prayed he would not feel too out-of-place.\n\nAs I walked in the kitchen I found my friend Shannon, the one I hadn't seen since we were kids. We immediately embraced like long-lost sisters and I felt none of the awkwardness you sometimes feel when you run into old high-school friends you haven't seen or talked to in years. We caught up quickly, as I was aware I was there to do a job. There were a few other people I knew or recognized, and many I didn't, but within moments we were all working side-by-side like we'd been scrubbing kitchens together our whole lives and it was the most natural thing for us to be doing at that moment. As I chatted to some of the other folks I found out some of them had been former campers, some former staff, others were parents or spouses of former campers or staffers. But everyone was there, gladly giving up their Saturday, because Caroline Furnace had touched their lives in some way.\n\nI later found out there were over 70 people that came throughout the weekend to get dirty, sweat, and share their camp memories. Some of us knew each other before the weekend, others didn't. But you wouldn't know it looking from the outside in, because we all seemed like old friends in moments. We were only there for 7 hours that day, but by the end my kids were begging me for playdates and sleepovers with the new friends they'd made and worked alongside, my husband was laughing and shaking hands with several guys he had just met that morning, and I was hugging tightly onto many friends, knowing it would not be soon enough until I saw them again.\n\nAs we pulled away I told my husband how much I appreciated him coming with me and spending his Saturday working on a place that was not his childhood home (or even childhood camp). And he said 'are you kidding, I loved it! I may not have gone to camp here as a kid, but our kids do, and I get why this place is so important to you. There's just something really special about Caroline Furnace.' \n\nYes. Yes, there is.",2,6

Colorguard, dancing, singing - I loved it all. It wasn't until I moved to Chicago that my whole perspective of performing would change. I was out at dinner with a few friends and we started talking about dance. My friend Katie told me about the Chicago Spirit Brigade. An all-adult, all-volunteer cheerleading, dance and drill team that performed around Chicago to raise money for charity.\n\nI thought, “Why not?” I was looking for an activity to fill that performance gap. At the time, my mind wasn't focused wholly on fundraising - but performing.\n\nI went to tryouts and instantly fell in love. I was surrounded by people that I felt I could really be myself around. We practiced all through the winter months, doing small events here and there, we also went away to camp to perfect our Mega-Routine. As the warmer months approached I was so excited to debut this performance and show off all of our hard-work.\n\nOur first big festival performance was Midsommarfest in Andersonville. We had warmed up, gathered a crowd and started setting up our red spirit (donation) buckets around the edge. I had butterflies - the sun was hot and the crowd was huge! Little did I know that about 12 minutes later, my life was going to change for good.\n\nWe did our performance and the crowd went wild! I was on cloud 9. It wasn’t until after we performed that I picked up my red spirit bucket and started walking around to collect donations (We were collecting for Apna Ghar that weekend). To my amazement people were donating left and right! Dropping singles, fives, tens, TWENTIES! Everyone was congratulating us on a wonderful job and donating to such a wonderful cause.\n\nI couldn’t believe I was a part of something that does such beautiful work for the community. People will pay hundreds of dollars for tickets to see a stunning performance - we didn’t charge people to watch us, we simply asked that they donate if they could.\n\nThe Chicago Spirit Brigade also offers a unique matching program. For every dollar donated, we match that by 25%. After our performances we donate 125% to our beneficiary for that event. We don’t keep a single dollar for ourselves. Most of our beneficiaries are local charities that do a multitude of things for those in our community who need it most.\n\nTo be able to use my dance skills and have such a direct impact on my community was life-changing.

My years as a daily meditator and as a nurse deepened my understanding of empathy and drew me to Cusco somehow. The abandoned Cusco children sleeping in doorways and stealing food to survive found me and surrounded me every day sharing their lives with me and completely changing mine. Desperate young mothers would often try to give me their swaddled infant speaking to me in the Quechua dialect I didn't understand. A mother myself, I could not mistake her meaning and it shook my world and changed my future forever. \n\nIn 1987 I founded Chicuchas Wasi(CW) an emergency shelter for many of the children I had come to know and love.

Trying to raise money and awareness is difficult for a few reasons the way I see it.\nReason 1: When kids are first dx with CAS, the financial burden on the family is astronomical.  Many times (most times) insurance doesn't pay and families are left to figure out how to fund therapy for at least 3x a week (current recommended frequency for CAS is 3-5 times per week).  Since CAS frequently has additional co-morbidities, additional cost of therapy for OT and PT may be warranted as well (also not covered under insurance).  During this time, families can barely stay above water much less donate money to the charity who has been working hard to make life better for them.\n\nReason 2: Kids can overcome CAS with the appropriate treatment, frequency, and intensity.  As wonderful as this is, kids get better and people move on.  Around the time families might be able to donate, they move on as their child has overcome apraxia.  It's unlike many other childhood neurological disorders in this way.\n\nI wish what people realized, is that even though there is a lot of work to do, the resources available to families living with apraxia now are so much more prolific than they were 20 years ago.  That is not an accident or coincidence.  It's the direct result of the work done by CASANA, the Childhood Apraxia of Speech Association of North America.  A mom, like me, like you, had a child who couldn't speak.  She knew something was wrong but professionals told her not to worry.  They went a year with no progress before seeking out other options, and even then, she had to trust her mommy gut.  There wasn't anyone to ask or bounce ideas off of. Her son's disorder wasn't even called apraxia then!    There were numerous professionals who didn't think it existed! \n\nThat alone shows where we have come, but we came that far because of people like Sharon who founded CASANA. The efforts of CASANA made it possible for:\n• CAS to be recognized as a separate and distinct disorder only in 2007!  \n• Fund research so that SLP's are using best practice and our kids have access to best practice to ensure the best possible outcomes\n• Headed the efforts for CAS to have a national awareness day on May 14th starting only a few short years ago\n• Disseminate information on their website apraxia-kids.org\n• Offer webinars and professional conferences for SLP's looking to learn more about dx and treatment for apraxia\n• Moderate a facebook group where they provide invaluable advice for parents\n• Fund grants for speech therapy via Small Steps in Speech\n• Fund grants for iPads\n• Promote walks and offer support and materials for volunteers who would like to organize one in their hometown\n• Print information materials such as the brochure I gave Ronda that day where she read it front to back and knew instantly that was the disorder she had!\n• Ensure that 85% of profits return directly to CAS related programs.  85%!!!\n\nFriends, we are here and are in a better place because of CASANA.  Honestly, there is just no other truth than that.  I tell you this professionally and personally. I know the staff members at CASANA.  They all wake up every day with one goal: to make the lives of the children affected with CAS better; and you know what?  My child's life, and your child's life are better because of them.\n\n#GivingTuesday,  December 1st is a national 'Day of Giving.'  Please, please consider donating to CASANA.  Ronda Rousey, a famous MMA fighter would not have spread awareness to millions like she had because I wouldn't have had their brochure the day I met Ronda.

To read that story, go here: http://themighty.com/2015/08/when-we-asked-ronda-rousey-if-she-had1-apraxia-of-speech/\n\nWe have a saying amongst a group of us and it's 'we do this for our kids and we do this for all those who will come AFTER.'

I would go to class, sleep ( a lot), and even hit the gym sometimes. I was new to UCF's campus, and was just trying to find my place.That lead me to join my school's Student Government Association. Being a part of such a large network of student leaders on campus was great, but what I didn't realize was that joining SGA was my first step in discovering my true passion. You see, that first year I was highly encouraged to participate in our school's largest student-run philanthropy which fundraises money for our local Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. That student-run philanthropy is Knight-Thon, UCF's Dance Marathon. Like many other freshman, I was an expert at procrastinating. It was about a week before the big event, and I realized that I had still not done the fundraising I had set out to do. Many collegiate students can attest to the fact that school life gets chaotic and time seems to slip away from us. I realized at that moment that I was not as knowledgeable as I should have been going into such a big event. Nonetheless, I trudged forward and fundraised the goal that I had set for myself. The day of the Dance Marathon had arrived and I was very excited at the prospect of standing for 20 hours with all of my friends. I was having a wonderful time at my first Dance Marathon, but I was still blissfully unaware of how much of an impact the hospitals we fundraise for make. All I knew was that we were fundraising and standing For The Kids. We were fairly far into the event, when everything clicked. My energy was diminishing when a we were asked to kneel down as a family walked up to the stage to tell their story. This was a miracle family treated by one of the hospitals we benefit. The children who were on stage were both born prematurely and were kept inside incubators in the Neo-Natal Intensive Care Unit for the first portion of their life. Their dad even described them as being so small that he could fit his wedding band up their legs. It was in that moment that I realized that these kids and so many others are alive and happy because of Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. It was an absolutely incredible feeling to know that the UCF Community had come together for such an amazing cause. As tears streamed down my face, something awoke in me. I came to the realization that I want to do anything and everything I can to benefit this amazing organization. Since then, not a day has gone by that I haven't done something For The Kids.

She was a red-haired lady who had lost her son to cancer and she had this magical softness and empathy that allowed her to break through my mom's rage and denial. I overheard them talking and for the first time, I heard her cry and talk about not getting to meet her grandchildren someday. \n\nBecause of Bridget, I think I realized that her fight wasn't just about surviving because she was too young to die. She wanted to survive for me too. And she wanted to survive so she could meet my children. \n\nMy mom was a lot calmer after Bridget's visits and because her pain was under control. So, after five and a half months of a terrible nightmare, we had some lovely, peaceful days at the end because of Bridget and the whole hospice team. \n\nBecause of what they did for us, I volunteer a bit of time (and money whenever I'm able) when my kids are in school to sit with terminal patients who are with Community Hospice. I know I can never live up to how magical Bridget was but I hope that I can repay her a little bit by trying to be someone else's Bridget and maybe bring comfort to another family.\n#mygivingstory",1,2

First, it’s a barrage of advertisements that tell me I need to look a certain way and act a certain way to qualify as a “real woman.” Second, it’s news stories that document the sad state of women around the world. Now, I don’t have a doctorate in world problem solving, but I have enough common sense to understand that the only way girls and women will come out of feeling like their looks define them is through education and encouragement. Girls need to be made to feel special and empowered, instead of defined by the color of their skin or how they dress.\n\nSix years ago I had the opportunity to travel to India. I saw firsthand how western marketing had a stronghold over how the women saw themselves. Several times I was told flat out that I was more beautiful than Indian women because I had lighter skin. I’d always smile and tell them I would love to have their dark skin tone. \n\nWhen I returned to the U.S. I went on with my life. Then, in 2011, I was reminded of how much young girls around the world need to be told they’re worthy of everything young boys are. My job required significant involvement in a mission trip to India. I was reminded of sad stories of girls being valued less than boys. Education, food and other basic necessities were more often withheld from girls because they were perceived as less valuable. Marrying a female child off was far more expensive than marrying a male child off. Girls were a burden.\n\nThe day I was reminded of these stories was the day I decided to get out of my American consumer driven mindset and recognize the needs of someone other than myself. Technology meant I didn’t have to wait for the “right opportunity.” I could get online, pick a country and a child and donate to help fund their education, healthy meals and medical care. For less than the cost of a Starbucks frappe-mocha-whatever a day I had the power to be the change.\n\nI logged on to Compassion International's website, an organization I had heard of through other people who sponsored children, and chose a little girl from India. Compassion has a long history of impacting the lives of children around the world. \n\nThis young girl’s sweet dark braids and brown eyes spoke to me. In her I saw the potential that others may have overlooked. While she might feel invisible being one in a billion, I saw her as the opposite: uniquely one in a billion. \n\nMy small monthly gift would provide her with nutrition and the energy needed to study and to walk to and from school. Studying would give her the education she needed to escape the trap of poverty she had the misfortune of being born into. Local community mentors would sow seeds of encouragement and love in her daily life. In this young child was the potential that every human being is born with. She simply needed someone to recognize it and on that day the right person was me.\n\nIn a way, giving to Compassion was like paying homage to my cultural roots - giving back to the country that birthed my grandfather and ultimately my family, but it was so much more. It taught me that how children see the world is contingent on their interactions with other people. While I can’t control how everyone treats children, I can lead by example and ensure I make a difference from my corner of the world. ",3,1

A lion 'oofs,' after being prompted by a human who loves him, and 15 other lions answer to convey that all is well in their world.  An adorable binturong climbs across the top of her cage upside down to remind you that you should bring her a banana. A chubby but adorable leopard stalks you from one end of her large compound to the other end hoping for a treat.  A caracal trills and shows you her 'best side' profile as you pass by her with your camera. A serval bonds with his happy human by marking her forever with his scent and a wolf shows one of his human pack members by laying his head in her lap.\n\nEach of these beautiful animals, and the people who care for and support them, are the reason I volunteer my time and talents to the Conservators Center in Burlington, NC.\n\nThe center is not a zoo and is not supported by any government funds.  It is a privately owned and funded by donations and, quite simply, love. A few dedicated staff members work tirelessly to coordinate animal care, promotion and publicity of the animals and the center, and the day-to-day business of running a center that cares for over 80 animals who have been rescued or retired to their care. Even more volunteers, like myself, give countless hours to prepare food and feed the animals, clean the animal living areas and provide enrichment for the animals to keep them engaged and happy, guide tours of the center's animals for the public and tell their stories, socialize the animals and show them love, and so much more.  \n\nI first met the animals and people of the Conservators Center when I took a tour with 100 schoolchildren.  I was in awe of the volunteer tour guides who answered every child's question and introduced us to animals I recognized, like tigers and lions, and animals I had never heard of like binturongs, caracals and genets.  They told us the backstory of every single animal.  We learned that one of their bobcats came to them after being mistaken for an injured domestic cat and that their employees rescued a 'mutt' after driving hundreds of miles to pick up a rare New Guinea Singing Dog and discovering he was only a mutt. We met lions and tigers living in a 'mixed pride' because the founders of the center rescued the animals when another facility was shut down and, while they were unprepared to take on so many animals, they creatively found ways to make it work so that the animals could live happily and with an extraordinary quality of life.\n\nI knew from the first day that I wanted to spend time at the Conservators Center and work with them on their mission to reconnect people with wildlife.  In the past year, I've volunteered many hours on nights and weekends to help out in any way that I could.  My favorite event was when students from the school for the blind visited the center.  Volunteers and staff members made sure that each student learned as much as they could about the animals through their senses other than vision.  We shared casts of pawprints to show the students how large the animals were.  We took them on a tour and prompted the lions and wolves to rumble the earth with their roars and howls. We shared stories of the animals that brought them to life for these sweet students who could not see them.  \n\nThe Conservators Center is my 'happy place.'  Every chance I get to volunteer my time there is time well spent.  Each tour that I drive a golf cart for a disabled person to see the animals and hear their stories brings joy to my heart.  I hope to share the amazing animals and their two-legged friends who love them at the Conservators Center with as many people as I can.  I hope that you'll visit them in person to learn how amazing they are but the next best thing is their website at www.conservatorscenter.org where you can learn the story of how they came into being and virtually meet some of the most amazing animals on the planet!",2,2

The music was loud, his voice was bad, and his rhythm was questionable – but he was free.\n\nFast-forward a few years to a nervous sixth grader sitting at attention in the flute section in the middle school orchestra. Instruments up, and the first notes of a piece called “Prelude and March” filled the room. It wasn’t Vivaldi or Tchaikovsky, but it was classical. \n\nMy father was in the audience that night and for many years to come. He didn’t know the rules of attending a classical concert, and couldn’t intellectualize about the sophistication of the harmony or the variation of the music. But he was happy just the same to listen to and engage with the music. Always tapping his hands to the beat.\n\nMy father taught me that what mattered most wasn’t my skill in playing music, or my knowledge of the music. It was my ability to connect with it – regardless of genre – and to find satisfaction in the notes. \n\nNow, after retiring as a musician, I continue to help others find satisfaction in music by supporting the Denver Philharmonic Orchestra (www.denverphilharmonic.org). As a community orchestra, we aim to redefine the way our community experiences and engages with classical music. \n\nSometimes this means our concerts are noisy with audiences clapping between movements, and with kids getting up to go to the bathroom before intermission. And we do things differently. We tweet during concerts as a form of community outreach and spend time making sure our audience understands the music through pre-concert chats. Our musicians and our audiences come together at post-concert receptions where no question or comment is off limits. \n\nI am compelled to serve as a board member, volunteer and donor to the DPO to make sure a diverse group of people are able to find satisfaction in classical music. It thrills me when I see a kid’s face light up at the first notes and tap a parent’s shoulder to say “they really like it!” And I love to hear feedback after concerts from people who have never experienced a classical concert before, and were thankful both for the music and for the welcome they received. \n\nThis year, I found a new reason to support the DPO. I become a mother to a little boy. Andrew is 8 months old, and the joy of my life. In addition to regular mothering tasks, I take very seriously my job to be his cultural ambassador. He’s already attended a concert (even though start time is past his bedtime), and we spend time each week listening to music, singing together and shaking baby-friendly instruments to the beat. \n\nI don’t know if Andrew will be a musician, but I do know that he will find satisfaction in it – regardless of his knowledge or skill level.\n",1,2

When those systems are compromised, your body goes haywire. This ranges from anything from overwhelming fatigue to tachycardia to fainting to digestive dysfunctions to chronic pain… the list goes on. Some of us are bed bound, some of us can run marathons, but we all have one thing in common: our lives are never ending cycles of uncertainty. We take everything one day, one hour, one minute at a time.\n\nDysautonomia International was formed in the vacuum of patient advocacy and support groups.

They are there for me.\n\nDysautonomia International has become my family. Everything I give to them, I get back tenfold. This organization has connected me with a brilliant POTS specialist who has gotten to know me as a person and as a patient, an internship that allowed me to learn and grow as an individual while letting me take the time to take care of my needs, and has introduced me to individuals that care and comfort me as well as make me laugh harder than I thought possible.\n\nAs for my original diagnosing doctor, he has learned more than he ever thought possible from this organization. He has gotten involved with research and is now making this one of his specialties, something that would not have been possible without the work of Dysautonomia International.\n\nThis organization is my safe space. It is the voice of thousands who give them their time and get back their strength. They have given us information and resources but most importantly, they've given us back hope that we will be healthy and reclaim our lives again.",,

This organization has exposed me to new possibilities and broadened my understanding of disability. Before my encounters with the staff and clients at Everas, my perception of what life is like for an adult with disabilities was narrow and skewed.

We make assumptions about the quality and value of individuals before we know anything about them, and this is an unfortunate habit we as people need to break. \n\nEveras Community Services believes in abilities, and more importantly in possibilities. They provide specialized supports for individuals with varying degrees of disabilities so that these individuals can live with dignity amongst their peers. In addition to residential programs, Everas provides access to Day Services so that individuals facing barriers to employment and other opportunities gain access to the supports they need to flourish at work and in the community. They are committed to the people they support, and dedicated to a larger mission of striving for inclusion. \n\nAt Everas, care, quality, and respect are principles that guide every decision, every initiative, and every employee. I am inspired by Everas to give back because every individual has the right to live a meaningful life of purpose. At Everas, they seek first what a person can do, before prescribing labels that are limiting and often untrue.

I applied for the position and interviewed, not knowing if I would be the right fit, but knowing in my heart that I had the 'Type A' personality skill set that could help Extra Table get organized and hopefully be more effective. As most fairy tales go, I interview twice and got a call an hour after the second interview offering me the job as Program Coordinator. \n\nFast forward November 14, 2015. Extra Table was hosting its 3rd Annual Hattiesburg Hunger Run, a 5k, 10k and 1 mile Fun Run around Downtown Hattiesburg to help raise money for Extra Table. After the race, we hosted an after party for all of the runner to eat, drink enjoy some music and hopefully learn more about what Extra Table is doing in their area. While chatting with some of our volunteers and passing out plates of BBQ to runners, an older man, meek in appearance and timid to approach, walked up and asked if I worked with the group putting on the event. I told him that indeed I did. The gentleman smile lightly and proceeded to tell me a story, full of the very stuff that Extra Table was born out of. He told me his truth:\n\nHe was an AIDS patient. He had just recently moved to the Hattiesburg area and he was a client who received a monthly food box at our local food pantry and often partook of hot meals at our local soup kitchen. For the first time in 10 years, he was not homeless. He had secured an apartment of his own, just a few blocks from where the Race was being held. He just happened to be walking by and saw that everyone was having such a great time. When he asked a volunteer what the event was for, he was told about Extra Table and our mission. He didn't ask for money. He didn't ask for food. He didn't come to criticize or take advantage or even offer a suggestion. \n\nHe found me to thank me. \n\nHe said he knew what good work we must be doing, especially since everyone was having such a good time, and he just had to say thank you. \n\nI am but a small part of the much larger mission that is Extra Table, but my heart has become so embraced by countless stories like this one. I work for Extra Table with absolute joy and I fight on behalf of those who have been too weak, too scared, too ashamed, too outcast, too small and too neglected to be provided the basic need of a little food in their belly so that they can make it another day. \n\nI say all of this, not to say that I inspire myself, but to say that this man and the 670,000 hungry in Mississippi that he represents inspire me to give, to work, and to be better through Extra Table.",,

After college my career blossomed into full swing. I spent my first six months out of college with a pharmaceutical company, all I wanted was to help people get eh medicine that they needed. It was short lived, I was unhappy and unfulfilled, so I left. 2 more months passed and I found myself working for a nimble non-profit with one goal: we raise money to give back. Never had I had so much freedom, on my first day I was told find a cause you care about and partner with them- meet them, figure out how best you, and all of us, can help them. So I set out searching. a few days passed and in some matter of universal collusion we all stumbled upon one amazing cause; global, offline, quality education created and distributed by the Foundation for Learning Equality. The Foundation for Learning Equality is a group of collective geniuses trying to make the world a better place. They are made up of UCSD cognitive scientists, software engineers, inters,  and grad students and they were spending money out of pocket trying to get their project noticed and deployed. And they did- they had amazing success with their first platform. Three years ago the team released KA Lite. In those three years it has reached 2.1 million learners in over 160 countries. KA Lite is an open source offline Khan Academy platform and was implemented in rural schools, orphanages, community centers, refugee camps, prisons, and homes. From there it was carried through the “sneakernet” to completely offline communities. Now, I work with Foundation for Learning Equality daily, we offer pizza and advice and they take some of both. AT this point they have a campaign to raise money and awareness for their newest platform Kolibri and it is crunch time. I am doing everything in my power to try and get the word out for them. I sit at my desk trying to find email addresses and phone numbers for people I ever thought in a million years I would be trying to contact- all because I believe in this group. I believe in their product. Part of the reason that I feel so strongly about them is because of their leader. There has never been anyone so moving as the software lead architect- Jamie Alexandre. Jamie’s compassion and conviction for global quality education leaves you stunned, instantaneously feeling the magnitude and exceptional reach of Kolibri. In his own words, “we want to be a platform that empowers people to learn from locally relevant content… that really empowers them to create their own educational ecosystem.” His partner in the project, Richard Tibbles, Learning Lead, added to that “we don’t want to put extra barriers in the way of these people who already have so many barriers to their learning.” This is the type of group when you walk in a room you feel their energy, their blood, sweat and tears. This is the type of project you can’t walk away from, once you understand the enormity, the reach, the potential there is no going back. So I sit here, at my desk brain storming- how can I share, how can I contribute even the smallest bit such a gargantuan cause? Because this is what I do- I help people, however I can. This group, this amazing group, is beyond worth my time, your time, all of our time, and they need all of our help.

We went through therapist, caregivers, and finally hospice to help him through this horrible journey.  He died on July 29, 2013 just one week after his birthday.  He left behind two wonderful daughters and three grandkids that loved him very much.  After 43 years of marriage I did not want to give him up and let him go but knew it was for the best as he would no longer suffer with this horrible disease and be whole again.

I spent several trips fishing or hunting with my father and he let me ramble on and on.  I wanted to be the first woman President!!  In 2015, we still have yet to experience a woman president but the possibility looms.  I no longer have my Hero!  My Dad died on July 15, 2010 from a disease I had never heard of PSP - Progressive Supranuclear Palsy.  \n\nMy Dad was proceeding along in life just fine as he had just retired and was looking forward to retired life.  He and my mother had just bought a new home in 2006 in a quiet area away from the city in which they had resided for several years.  Dad had gotten himself a little step-side Ford PU - bright red and he seemed very content.  A short time later family members began to notice odd behaviors we had not witnessed before.  Dad would leave a room and then return looking as if he was lost and scared but then upon recognizing a familiar face would proceed right on into the gathering.  He also began to cough and struggle while eating and became very particular what he would ingest.  He also began to take a tumble every now and then.  \n\nDad went to his primary care physician and they did the same 'Parkinson's' tests twice!!  His doctor was sure he had Parkinson's but could not validate that diagnosis.  Everyone was concerned but no one knew where to turn next.  During this time of testing it was discovered my Dad needed to have a spinal surgery near the base of his head as his bone was very fragile and there was a space that needed to be repaired before Dad took a fall that could render him paralyzed.  Dad was not a very good patient.  This behavior was not typical of my happy go lucky Dad.  He was irritating nurses and pulling out his IV's.  The downward trend in behaviors and falls continued.  \n\nMy sister was a nurse and felt an appointment with a neurologist was in order.  Within fifteen minutes of my Dad walking in the door he gave us a PSP diagnosis.  The Dr. said he knew the moment he saw my Dad's fixed, gazing, dull eyes.  He also said Dad was at risk for choking to death and needed a feeding tube.  In 2009, my Dad was admitted to a nursing home.  He fell in the middle of the night one night and hit his head on the bathtub and tried to not let anyone know.  The hospital said home was no longer safe for him.  Dad fell again in the nursing home on July 4, 2010...he died July 15, 2010.\n\nI give to CurePSP and we made CurePSP a memorial for my Dad because I want more people to be educated and to know about CurePSP and how they can help people with this deteriorating disease.  I learned more about this disease after my Dad had died and wished we would have known about this foundation and the information we could have gained while he was still living.  \n\nI will continue to give to CurePSP as I am able and to pray for the many families affected to learn early on what can be done to make end of life easier on the patient and their families.  My Dad is still my Hero!  I continue to pass on to his grandchildren that they are capable of being anything their heart desires, and I know my father smiles every time he hears me say it.  \n\n",,

This July, it will be 4 years since he died of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP).  He was my inspiration, my hero, my mentor and my best friend.  He never gave up and selflessly gave of himself.  PSP completely took away the Dad I knew and everything that made him who he was.  I give in his memory in the hope that other people won't have to suffer like he did. \n\nPSP is an uncommon brain disorder that affects movement, balance, speech, swallowing, vision, mood, behavior, and thinking. The disease worsens (progressive) and causes weakness (palsy) by damaging certain parts of the brain. Currently there is no effective treatment or cure for PSP. \n\nMy Dad would drive three hours to my college just to take me supermarket shopping for 30 minutes.  My Dad video-taped and made audio cassettes for his car for every musical performance I was ever in.  My Dad sent me and my college roommates 100 pounds of chocolate on Valentine's Day…just because.  My Dad blew up life-sized versions of pictures of my children to hang on his office wall.  My Dad came over to my house every day after I had my first child just to see and hold my son for 5 minutes.  My Dad never got off the phone with me without saying I love you.  This was the kind of Dad I had. \n\nI first knew there was something really wrong when he fell down a flight of steps and put his head through a wall…and he didn't know how it happened.  I knew it when he couldn't remember common words when he was talking to you.  When he slurred his speech, when he would choke every time he ate, when he bought my Mom birthday cards for Mother's Day and forgot my birthday and didn't seem to care.  I promised him that I would take care of him...that WE would figure everything out.  \n\nI give to CurePSP so that we can continue to fight for a cure and give hope to other families that are devastated by this disease…to help THEM figure out what we weren’t able to solve.

She battled an extremely rare neurodegenerative disease called Progressive Supra Nuclear Palsy (PSP) for over 6 years, slowly losing ground.\n\nHaving to deal with an unexpected sudden death of a loved one is a terrible place to be in. On the contrary, awareness of an impending death is like having to look at an archer slowly sharpen his arrow, with the full knowledge that is being prepared for you and can strike you anytime. You are then at the mercy of a flick of his/His finger. We witnessed this process in all its glory for over 2000 days between 2008 and 2013.\n\n“Hope Matters” is the tagline of Cure PSP, the most prominent PSP care group in the world. And until much later I did not realize the importance of ‘hope’. My mom was a fighter. She fought until the very end. But what matters and what makes her a hero is that she fought with hope until the very end. She knew it was an incurable disease. Yet, she never gave up. She went to every single one of her doctor’s appointments with a hope that there might be some good news waiting for her -- probably some new medicine might have been discovered, or a new surgical procedure might have been found to cure her disease! She never missed a single dose of her medications, hopeful that it will do whatever little good it can. Every time a medication was changed, a dose was altered, she would do her own little test --trying to walk without anyone's support, a task she knew fully well she could not. A test that had almost always ended unfruitfully. Despite some falls and bruises, and multiple rebukes, she would wait for an opportune time, when she could try this without catching anyone's attention. It was only a hope that some medication might have worked and made her condition better.\n\nOne of the later symptoms of PSP is a condition called 'dysphagia.' Here, swallowing becomes increasingly difficult as the disease progresses. Let alone giant pills, swallowing even mashed potatoes becomes an ordeal. In her last few months, despite immense pain and discomfort, she went through this pill-swallowing ordeal four times a day, every single day. Even when we missed giving her a dose, mostly to save her the pain and choking that would follow, she would adamantly ask for the pills and willingly go through the ordeal. For me, that's hope, right there, in its purest form. She was hopeful that someday, someone, somewhere, would find a cure to PSP. She fought until her last breath, quite literally here, as on her last breath she choked on a small sip of water. Until the very end, her mind did not give up. It was her body that betrayed, while her hope was present even in the most hopeless situations.\n\nSo ladies and gentlemen, here's some unsolicited advice. Never lose hope. When you think that you might miss a goal, a bus, a train, a meeting, or a deadline, walk a little faster, run a little longer, work a little smarter, and try a little harder. Like my mom would often say, 'you never know if you are going to make it until you make it.'\n\nWe have supported #CurePSP periodically through small donations. Wearing their 'Hope Matters' wristbands has led to unexpected conversations at unexpected places, giving me a chance to raise awareness. Please #givethanks to CurePSP whose mission it is to raise awareness of this cruel disease and host support group meetings for caregivers and their families. CurePSP also strives to advance research that can cure this Prime of Life debilitating disease.",,

About 3 years before he died we both realized something was very wrong.  Bob fell unexpectedly, had double vision,  and definite signs of cognitive loss.  His right leg did not work well for him.  We sought medical help but received only a misdiagnosis- or Alzheimer's and then to explain the physical symptoms- myesthenia gravis- a very unlikely combination of illness to appear at the same time.  It seemed to me as though a label was slapped on my husband and we were sent away. However an ophthalmologist  who was mystified by Bob's symptoms suggested we rule out PSP.  I got onto the Cure PSP website to study the symptoms and then realized they fit Bob's condition.  We found our way to a university Neurology Institute  where we got the correct diagnosis.  But I knew the doctor there was struggling to tell us the facts.  Cure PSP gave is the information we needed to manage this fatal disease as well as possible and let us know what to expect.

In fact, I love everything about Free Minds. Every time I come into contact with the program, whether it be a trip to their website, reading the Connect newsletter in the mail, attending their volunteer Write Nights, speaking to their inspiring “poet ambassadors” and staff, or having them come to speak to students in my school, I feel a unique and intense sense of enrichment.  \n\nFree Minds is an unusual program that provides a book club and poetry workshop for youths incarcerated as adults in the DC jail.  It follows the youths by correspondence when they are sent to federal prisons and provides reentry support, including a month-long apprenticeship program, when they return.   Free Minds members who have served their time act as Poet Ambassadors, leading workshops in high schools and middle schools and speaking at monthly Write Night volunteer opportunities.  They always emphasize how Free Minds saved their souls when they were in a very dark place. That would be reason enough for giving to Free Minds.  \n\nHowever, I also love supporting Free Minds for more selfish reasons. I have become addicted to the way it creates human connections across the many walls that separate the fortunate ones in our society from the less fortunate.  When I attend Write Night and sit with a poem written by an inmate I get an uncanny feeling of direct communication with someone who society has placed out of bounds, someone for whom words and poetry have taken on huge significance.  This connection is an amazing feeling for me personally.  Like many people I know, I am deeply concerned about mass incarceration, solitary confinement, and the channeling of adolescents into the adult criminal justice system.  Free Minds gives me the opportunity to open a direct line of communication with individuals who are caught up in that system. \n\nAnd speaking of individuals, I love the way Free Minds individualizes and humanizes inmates.  They are no longer to me an undifferentiated group of people, they are D’Angelo, Delonte, Demetrich, etc., people who I have grown to know a little bit from the intimate reflections contained in their poetry and been able to connect with through commenting on their literary works.  \n",,

Believing, as I do, that my relative comfort and privilege entails obligations, I contribute to a lot of charitable organizations and non-profits. But of all of them, Free Minds Book Club is the only one that warms my heart whenever I think of it, and it’s this – that Free Minds helps its members find their voices and fosters in them a community – that sets it apart.\n\n I have volunteered at Free Minds Write Nights for a number of years, and in that time I have heard over and over again from the Free Minds members how Free Minds found them, hard and angry and isolated, cold and mute as stones in their cells, and drew them out through shear persistence. Through the Book Club, Free Minds found the dim embers of self-awareness in so many of these young men (and women), and nurtured them until they sparked into voices with which the members could begin to think critically about themselves, their choices, and the consequences of those choices. The poems that we have the privilege of reading and responding to at Write Night are testimonials to this process. \n\nIndeed, over the years, I have witnessed Free Minds members who are out of prison – who were incarcerated during the years when most people develop their adult selves - growing into articulate and self-aware young men. The title Free Minds has given them – Poet Ambassadors – is apt. And I have seen how the Poet Ambassadors see themselves as a community, relying on each other and supporting each other in their struggle to turn their lives around.

Together we watched the film Rosenwald, a story of a partnership between Jewish and African-American communities that resulted in the building of over 5,000 schools for African-American children in the early 20th Century.  After the film we discussed the film over dinner at a local diner.  These young men had spent many years in Federal prisons after being convicted as adults while teenagers.  I was so impressed with their maturity; their understanding of the importance of community; their interest in black history; and their comfort level with me. Sharing hamburgers and milkshakes with these young men was an energizing, learning, experience, that left me with great hope for the future of Free Minds Book club members.  \n\nThe second volunteer opportunity was participation in Write Night, an evening open to the public to read and reflect on poetry written by Free Minds Book Club Members still in the Federal prison system.  The poems drew me into the lives of each person: their hurt; their loneliness; their honesty; their determination; and their courage in putting into writing their emotions, fears, and dreams. I found myself more consciously listening to the stories of journeys very different from my own; more awake to our shared need of community and love. \n\nThank you Free Minds Book Club Members for broadening my understanding of community!  \n",,

Turpentine Creek rescues Tigers, Lions, Cougars, Bobcats, Black Bears, a Grizzly and other assorted creatures that come from private homes and facilities that can no longer take care of these beautiful creatures.\n\nMy husband and I were struggling financially, my husband needed a second job. Scott Smith hired him to drive the tour trolley, he has many skills but was grateful to have this job. This blessing of a job helped us make ends that were far from being met, to being met. About 6 months after my husband started working at TCWR they got a call that turned out to be their biggest rescue ever. A woman in Mountainburg, AR had a very large collection of Tigers in very poor conditions and, as we found out later, very poor health. My husband and I went from being grateful for this income, to having hearts sold out to helping these magnificent creatures. In order to rescue all 28 cats, that were eventually transported to TCWR, homes needed to be built for them. My husband took his vacation from his full time job and helped weld homes for them on Rescue Ridge, the new area for these new residents. We saw some very sick animals come to Turpentine Creek and we wished we could help financially but we were barely getting by. I volunteered time in the office while my husband worked but we wanted to do more. Specially for the ones needing extra healthcare.\n\nToday, if one of the animals is sick and they can not be treated on site they need to be anesthsised, transported to the vet (about 40 miles away) kept under anesthsia while being treated and then while being transported back. A very serious situation for the animal, as well as staff. It's always been a dream at Turpentine Creek Wildlife Refuge to build an onsite Vetinary Hospital. Something my husband and I wished we could make happen. Something that seemed totally out of reach but very necessary.\n\nIn April of 2014 my husband and I were blessed with a very big windfall and one of the first things we did was make a very large donation towards building the Vet Hospital at Turpentine Creek Wildlife Refuge. A campaign kicked off and all the money for the building has been raised but what good will the building be with no equipment?

In October 2011 I adopted a sweet little Cocker Spaniel at a Petco in Lee’s Summit, MO.  After this experience and learning about rescue I visited the rescues website and I just kept coming back to it week after week.  I didn’t need to adopt another dog but for some reason I just kept coming back to their page.  In early 2012 I saw a little dog on their website, Joe Cocker (a Cocker Spaniel mix) and he needed a foster home.  I thought to myself….I can do this and the rest is history.   Joe was a tough case, he was a biter due to the abuse he received in his former home, he hated people but loved other dogs, and he loves me.  Yes, Joe Cocker is still with me and he will be forever.  Since that fateful day I have fostered over 100 dogs in my home, normally I foster 2 or 3 at a time.  Every time I go to the shelter and see all of the helplessness and the soulful eyes staring at me my heart just breaks.  It’s the little guys, the ones that have never had a haircut, matted with eyes almost impossible to see.  It’s the seniors whose owners surrendered because they are old or somehow became strays at the age of 10. It’s the ones that I know the owners will never come to re-claim, those are the ones I must help.  To go to a shelter and see these dogs, shaking, fearful, not knowing what the heck has happened to their life and wondering when their family will come for them. In some cases I feel they have given up or are hoping their family won’t come, they just want to escape the neglect and abuse. Some are so young I wonder if they have ever even experienced love and the older ones I can feel their broken hearts.  It is so hard to explain but until you actually walk the rows at the shelter it is a memory that will haunt you.  Every dog I bring home I help them become healthy and happy.  I love them as if they are my own, and they are mine until I find them a perfect forever home. All of this is possible through the group I foster for, Furry Kids’ Refuge.  Living in Missouri, one of the states notorious for back yard breeders and puppy mills it is just devastating the number of animals that are in the Missouri shelter system.  Sometimes I feel so overwhelmed and I bite off more than I can chew but I always feel in my heart that I always have room for one more. Yes, I miss out hanging out with friends, shopping, vacations and even spending time with my family BUT these little guys are in my heart and helping them is just something I must do.  After my fosters are adopted I love to receive updates, photos and the occasional visit. I even doggysitt for some of them!

A friend told me of a newly-opened and struggling homeless shelter that could use the leftovers. I immediately fell in love with their mission. I asked about their needs and found that, due to a lack of cribs, babies and toddlers were literally sleeping on the floor in blankets. It was a problem waiting to be solved! I organized a community drive and got them all the cribs they needed. \n\nI also learned they hadn’t yet scheduled a Christmas party. So, myself and a rag-tag group of friends and family organized a party for the 17 children at the shelter.  The years have flown by, as this December will mark 20 years of running the party. Our one little party has grown as we arranged, last year, to have Santa bring toys to 115 boys and girls in five area shelters.\n\nBut how did we make Santa cry? Since the real Santa is not always available, we get one of his “helpers” to stand in. Four years ago we needed a volunteer, so we asked a no-nonsense, flooring and tile man--a least likely candidate--to play the role of Santa. After a bit of nudging from his wife, he agreed.\n\nWhen Santa made his entrance, this sweet, little boy (in photo) ran to him and gave him a huge hug. But it wasn’t just any hug. It was a “Love Hug.”  He professed his love for Santa over and again. He refused to eat, even rebuffing offers of cookies. He paid little attention to the toy from Santa. He stood by Santa’s side for the entire night. \n\nAs volunteers, we try hard not to show emotion as we go about our work. These families often come to the shelters with only the shirts on their backs. But we are only human. And yes, sometimes our hearts break. And in the case of the rough and gruff tile man? He may not admit it, but he shed a tear, maybe two.\n\nBy the way, over the years, I also noticed canned and boxed goods in the shelter pantries but next to zero fresh fruit and vegetables. I set out to change that. I founded an organization which raises funds, buys fresh produce from farmers and distributes that to shelters, food banks and soup kitchens in a two county area.\n\nWe named the organization Gemma’s Angels, in memory of my mother Gemma Rose Macchioni, a loving woman who taught me how to give.\n\nOh, and our volunteer Santa has been with us ever since.

Several years ago, when I was caregiving my dying parents and experienced the death of 4 immediate family members in one calendar year (whew!), GAFW provided frequent outreach hikes, that gave me opportunities to get into our beautiful forests with knowledgeable, trustworthy hike leaders, who provided guidance and support as I sought much needed nature breaks in the woods.  Those first hikes as a follower have evolved into a network of forest friends and wonderful times shared in the woods. Now, for the first time, I am going to take a turn leading these hikes.  The work of GAFW is a challenge for this small non-profit and requires extensive expertise about forest management and ecology as well as frequent boots on the ground, investigating management practices and what their effects might be.  Forestwatchers are the ones actually reading and responding to the reams of forest management documents produced by the US Forest Service — no small feat.

In 2011, I got the opportunity to join the board of a small nonprofit called Ghana Educational Collaborative whose mission it is to provide financial support to exceptional students with significant financial need. As a teacher myself, I feel very strongly about GEC's belief in education as a gateway for endless opportunity and the notion that every child around the world deserves access to education as a right. \n\nFor 4 years I have fundraised to support the 11 students in the GEC program. For my birthday this year, I decided to throw a fundraiser for GEC, charging friends and loved ones $20 at the door, with all proceeds going to GEC. I was rather uncomfortable with the idea of asking my underpaid teacher friends to donate their hard earned money, but I figured if everyone was able to give a little, we could hopefully raise enough money to send at least 1 of our students through another year of school. \n\nIn the end, I was overwhelmed by the outpouring of support from my peers who, as I said, make very little money themselves.

With a virtual museum, you might think that it is difficult to see how your support is making an impact on the world, but the world of social media makes it much easier. To see girls interacting with our exhibits, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and blog shows that we are doing something meaningful. I remember a time when we were contacted by someone looking for resources about girls being bullied. We did not have anything on the topic at that time, but it provided an opportunity for us to research bullying and create a resource that could be accessed online. Our Spring 2015 exhibit on girls in STEM was so popular that people wanted more. So we just launched a follow-up exhibit about girls in STEAM. Accepting feedback and suggestions from patrons is one thing, but the fact that we are able and willing to act on those sets us apart. We are filling gaps that have been wide open for ages.

I had prior exposure to Girls on the Run, so I knew what an incredible organization it was, and I was excited to get involved on a deeper level. As I started coaching, practices became the highlight of my day. We only had six girls on our team, but they were so committed. Practice provided a safe space for them to talk about things that they couldn’t always talk about in the classroom walls. They actively participated in lessons and we could see them becoming more self-confident with every conversation and every run. All of our girls completed the 5k at the end of the season and every parent of our girls came to support them. In a school that often struggles with family engagement, I think this showed how important this was to the girls and their families. \n\nAlthough every girl on our team grew throughout the season, there was one particular girl who really came out of her shell over the course of the season. She was the quietest girl on the team, as well as the only 8th grader, and she often would not speak up in practice. She also needed a lot of encouragement to run in practice. As the season went on, she became more comfortable and opened up more in practice. The other girls on the team would encourage her, both to speak up and to run. I often ran with her in practice to encourage her to run for longer periods of time before walking because I knew she could do it. She was awarded a spirit award by her teammates at the end of one of the practices, and you could see how much it meant to her by the smile on her face. I was especially proud to see her finish the 5k at the end of the season.\n\nTo continue my giving to Girls on the Run, I decided to become a SoleMate for the Marine Corps Marathon this past fall.

Here she was, about to attempt something many adults had never done—that I had never done—and she was beaming and jumping around like she was at a dance party.  The energy of these Girls on the Run was infectious, and it was obvious their ten-week training in both running and self-esteem had served them well.\n\nI signed my daughter up for Girls on the Run http://www.girlsontherun.org/ because I had read that pre- and post-testing actually showed increases in self-esteem due to its twice weekly program.  I thought anything that could help inoculate us before the looming adolescent years was well worth it.  I had no idea how it would change my life and the lives of my daughters.\n\nMy daughter crossed the finish line that morning with a final sprint and an enormous, proud grin on her face. I was beyond astonished by what she had accomplished, especially because I was the kid who hated to run.  When we had to run around the school in junior high, I would actually hide after one lap and then rejoin the group on lap four or five.  I like other sports, but I just hated, hated, hated running.\n\nWhen spring came and it was time to sign up for Girls on the Run again, I didn’t hit “enter” fast enough, and my daughter didn’t make the team that filled up quickly.  A number of other girls in the school also wanted to be in the program and long story short, I ended up starting a second team and volunteering as the assistant coach.  My lack of running skills didn’t impede my coaching gig;  I helped lead the activities and discussions and left the running to the real coaches.  About half-way through the ten weeks though, I realized I wouldn’t be much of a role model if I didn’t actually run the final 5k race with the girls.  How could I back out of something these young girls were working so hard to conquer?  \n\nI went out one morning and ran my first twenty minute run.  I have no idea how far I managed with my ragged breathing and pounding heart, but I walked at least half the time.  I still hated running – almost every single minute of it.  But when I finished, I found myself constantly thinking about when I could fit in my next run.  By the time the race came, just a few weeks later, I was still hating running, but the unstoppable energy of hundreds of elementary school girls carried me through that first race.\n\nSix years later, I am proud to call myself a runner.  Running has become a treasured part of my life and one of the biggest gifts I give myself. I’ve run ten Girls on the Run 5ks with my oldest and my middle daughter.  I’ve also done a couple ten mile races and a half marathon on my own.  Running surprised me like almost nothing else in my life so far (and everyone who ever knew me when I was younger – including my husband!). Running with my daughters, getting to witness every step of their perseverance and tenacity first hand, has given me some of my most joyous and proud moments as a parent. My oldest now runs on the cross country team and has broken a seven-minute mile.  She can run circles around me, and I couldn’t be happier about it.\n\nGirls on the Run makes it easy for me to support them; every time I sign up one of my daughters (and my third is ready and waiting to join as soon as she’s old enough), they allow me to give extra to let girls who need extra financial help with fees or running shoes participate.  I can use my match at work and know I’m giving the same transformative experience me and my daughters have had to girls who wouldn’t otherwise experience it. The confidence and strength you get from doing something you never dreamed you can do is incomparable. It’s been said before, but it has truly been one of those gifts where we have received so much more than we have given.\n",,

The toy drive gives comfort and brings happiness to those who are less fortunate. I believe my charity has brought hope to many children who feel alone, rejected or judged. \n\nThis summer, I delivered 75 toys and games to the Good Shepherd Rehabilitation Hospital Pediatric Unit- Bethlehem.

It guides me through life and helps me see that I’ll be okay and unlike some teenagers, it motivates me to put my frustration into something productive.\n\nMy toy drives not only comfort others, but they help me to personally manage my own worries and prove that the smallest movement, the tiniest of ideas can start a prodigious movement.  As a teenager, I sometimes feel stereotyped. But with my toy drives, I want people to know that underestimating and stereotyping only makes them less knowledgeable.

A place of stark poverty, and for many, little hope. I traveled to this place that would appear, for most of us, to be uninhabitable- where such basic needs as food, water, and education, are scarce and often unmet.  It was here, in this dark place, that my eyes were opened.  Perhaps it was because of the bleak darkness that any glimmer of light- the stars in the night sky, a dim bulb powered by a humming generator, or the smile of bright white teeth on an ebony face, shone even brighter.  In a country of nearly 15 million, 95% are non-Christians, people live on less than $1.25 per day, and the literacy rate is only 33%. I realized my purpose while serving on a medical mission to Mali, West Africa, a few years ago, and I give now to remind myself what I witnessed while I was there.  I give to keep a light shining somewhere deep within me, a light that I hope others will see.  I hold it high, and hopefully it will be so bright they won’t be able to look away.  \n\nTraveling to Africa allowed me to see a world that I never knew existed.  Ironically, the greatest ‘burden’ of witnessing such poverty and extreme darkness, is returning home to life in the United States, attempting to reconcile the two worlds within my own mind.  I have struggled to find words to describe the experience to my family and friends.  I’m reminded often when I turn on the faucet and clean water is at my fingertips- knowing that at the same moment in Mali a woman is spending her day searching for water. I’m reminded of it when I see a beautiful school building and a bus that effortlessly delivers my child curbside, while in Mali a 9-year-old girl is willing to walk for miles to go to school, often without a meal in her tummy.  \n\nI see advertisements for things I will never need but am persuaded in gluttony to desire.  On my side of the world, there are warehouses full of food, endless electronics, giant stuffed teddy bears, pills to make me skinnier and better looking, and gadgets to think for me, all the while blinding me to pursuing anything beyond securing my own ridiculous comfort. From time to time, I wonder why so many Americans are enthralled with all of this shallow hype, why I, myself, am sometimes taken by it, and how it goes on and on, while others suffer in a world of ‘darkness’ and poverty.  But then I wonder which place, here or there, is blinder than the other.  \n\nAnd I wonder what I can do to make a difference. \n\nNow that I have seen it, I can’t look away.  I’d be a fool to look away.  My eyes have miraculously been opened. I want to help others recognize what they are missing- both here, in this land of numbing comforts and unappreciated indulgences, and in Mali, where even a small donation towards a Christian school can provide life-changing hope for children and families in need.  \n\n\nIt is this eye-opening experience that has made me realize God’s plan and why Jesus came to this world for us.  He IS GOD, He IS LIGHT, He IS LOVE, and he knows and sees ALL.  Yet He left the comfort of Heaven to come to us in this dark world and be a light so that we might be cured from our blindness.  He came to share, to lovingly give Himself for us, so that we might also see God’s GLORY and praise His name.  I want to GIVE to be a light to the nations and to give glory to God in heaven.  \n\nAlong with our family and precious friends, we founded Grace Missions, Inc. to support Ibrahima Kodio, an indigenous Christian missionary and his school in Mali.   Grace Missions improves educational opportunities for children in Mali, Africa and provides a Biblical foundation to their lives by sharing our abundance with those that have very little.  We provide hope and confidence for a better tomorrow.  We feel that education with a Biblical foundation is the key to a hopeful future, a lasting peace, and personal fulfillment in developing countries.  \n",,

The mission of GRG is encompassed by their Child First program. I have witnessed their support groups first hand and was relieved to know I was not alone and very grateful to realize how blessed my family is by comparison. Grandparents becoming “Parents Again” comes with struggles like new technology and different school work from when we raised our kids. However, the lack of legal documents is the biggest obstacle faced by many grandparents.  I learned quickly that our family was in better shape than most of these “grandfamilies” because we had a signed document allowing us to care for the grandchildren. The project I am proudest of was that I recently wrote instruction manuals for grandparents to be able to file a court petition to obtain Emergency Temporary Parental Responsibility by Relative Caregivers. Grandparents without legal documents have difficulty enrolling the children in school and getting them medical treatment.  These documents also allow the child to remain with the grandparents so they can thrive in a safe and loving home. Each time a grandparent can use this guide and file the papers without help from a lawyer; at least $1000 is saved. GRG is a nonprofit agency that has very limited funding so this type of savings is critical.  Projects like these allow me to #PayitForward making every day like #GivingTuesday.

When I awoke from my coma, I was told by my doctors that my stomach exploded. I couldn’t eat or drink, and it was not known when, or if, I’d ever be able to again.\n\nWith the expertise, audacity and innovative thinking of surgeons from seven hospitals, many 19-hour surgery marathons, and multiple shifts of nurses and doctors, I was miraculously reconstructed with the intestines that I had left.\n\nOver time, I made slow, but steady steps towards recovering my “personhood.” I learned to sit upright again. When my tracheotomy was removed, I started to talk. Once my hands were no longer shaky from the medications, I began to write and doodle. With time, patience, resilience, and persistence, the “me” I remembered started to come back – the “me” that 26 surgeries could never take away.\n\n\nBy 2012, I felt like I had finally made the “great comeback”.  I had written, starred, and directed myself in “Gutless & Grateful,” a one-woman musical about my life. I was happy, healthy, and had an ostomy. But everything is better in retrospect.  At that time, I felt I was happy and healthy, BUT, I had an ostomy.\n\nSo I took a risk.  I underwent an elective surgery to reverse my ostomy. Unfortunately, this elective surgery turned into three emergency surgeries within eight days, an ileostomy, a nicked bladder, a fistula, and a wound that will never close.\n\nAn Ostomy Nurse Helps with the Setback\n\nIt was so overwhelming and traumatic to try to figure out how to put a bag over this gaping wound – this wound that now functioned as a second ostomy.  Then, Tina, a very generous nurse with a truly compassionate heart, visited me at my home. Previously, I had been unwilling to receive any outside input. But after weeks of stuffing towels around my abdomen, I knew I had to come to terms with the idea that this wound needed a big intervention.\n\nThis was a very big deal to me. It was my acknowledgement that this surgery, that I had chosen, was truly a setback. And I had no idea how I would make a comeback.\nTina admired my spirit, and did everything she could to help me. She dropped off new bags in my mailbox daily, and was determined to help me until we could finally find a solution.\n\nShe saw the spirit in me that was numbed by this tremendous setback, and she was determined to get me out of the house again. It was hard for me to imagine that just months earlier, I had been singing and dancing in a satin red dress, singing about my “gutless and grateful life.”\n\nTina saw that spark in me, and nominated me for a Great Comebacks Award. She had seen my show in 2012, and knew that I was capable of making a comeback once again, even when I couldn’t imagine doing so.\n\n\nThings did get better. They got better because I was determined to make them better. I applied to college at 25. I booked two theaters to perform Gutless & Grateful again – updating the show with the 27th surgery for a little comic relief. I created an online dating profile for the first time, and met the love of my life, who is now my husband. I made a comeback, and I felt alive once again.\n\nThen, one day, while I was at school in Amherst, Rolf Benirschke, the founder of the Great Comebacks Award, called me personally. I was so thrilled, I could hardly speak.  This was the first time I was really recognized for what I had been through medically, as a true survivor.\n\nNot for my performance, my mixed media art or what I was doing in the community, I was being recognized for being a resilient, strong and proud ostomate.\nGreat Comebacks – Becoming Part of Something Bigger\n\n\nGreat Comebacks changed my life forever. Being the Eastern Regional Recipient was so much more than being honored for my personal achievements. Through Great Comebacks, I was able to meet other ostomates that were doing wonderful and inspiring things. Call me sheltered or naive, but I didn’t even know there was anyone my age with an ostomy!\n\nI had never known how to talk about my ostomy.  I didn’t know what an ostomy was until I had one. Part of me felt like it was “not something you talk about.” Even though I was never told this, I felt there was some kind of stigma, like I should be ashamed. Part of me felt like an outcast, like no one had what I had.\nI met a beautiful fashion model, a dancer, a teacher, a nurse, inventors, warriors, enthusiastic, vivacious amazing souls. And – something very foreign to me – they were so proud of their ostomies, and grateful that their ostomies enabled them to lead such happy, healthy, and full lives.\n\n\nGreat Comebacks was an amazing opportunity to be honored. So much of my own story had taken place in the dark, unknown to the outside world. Nobody knew how I’d spend hours in the bathroom changing my bags every morning. Nobody knew how, when I was unable to eat or drink for years, I’d lock myself in my room for every waking hour and journal. I avoided being  exposed to the outside world where normal people could eat and drink freely. It felt wonderful to be honest ,and share what coping with my medical situation was like for me. It also felt wonderful to gush about my father, a doctor who worked tirelessly to advocate for my health and save my life.\n\n\nGreat Comebacks was an important and truly amazing experience for me to have for my own personal sanity and emotional wellbeing. Part of me needed to know that, although I’m strong and can make a comeback just based my own love for life, I needed to know that others were doing it, too. Other “ostomates” who were SO much more than ostomates. Seeing these people embrace their bodies and situations changed my entire view on myself, and how I view self-acceptance and self-love.\n\nThe culmination of Great Comebacks was being honored in a ceremony at the National Convention of Wound, Ostomy, and Continence Nurses (WOCN) in Nashville, Tennessee. During the ceremony, videos of me, and the other regional Great Comebacks honorees, were filmed by Howie Klausner of Town Square Pictures, and shown to over 500 WOCN nurses.\n\n\nThese videos showcased how important WOC nurses are, and the impact of their work on real people like me. I cried as nurses came up to tell me things like, “It is so amazing for us to hear the impact we make on people. Thank you for sharing your story.”\n\nGreat Comebacks taught me to be proud, to be honest, and to love myself.\nI see the Great Comebacks Awards as an experience that brings everything full circle. ConvaTec, the amazing company that makes it possible for ostomates to take care of their ostomies properly, honored me and other amazing ostomates. At the ceremony, we gave back our thanks to the wonderful nurses who make everything possible for us.\n\nI owe thanks to my body, nurses, doctors, family, friends, and the strength in me to keep making comeback after comeback. And thank you, Great Comebacks for bringing us all together in this beautiful realization.\n",,

Living in Orlando, I have the opportunity of supporting those hospitals in our Greater Orlando area, which include Arnold Palmer Medical Center and UF Health Shands Children’s Hospital. \n\nWhy I Give\nWhen I think about why this cause and these hospitals means so much to me, there’s many things that come to mind. I’ve been fortunate to meet many families with kids who have been treated at these hospitals and every story has proved to be so unique. There are two miracle stories however that has always stood out to me. The first is Sam.  Sam is 14 years old and due to spina bifida, he has had 28 surgeries in his lifetime. The first time I met him, Sam’s mom was sharing his story and she said one thing that I will never forget. She said, “Of all my kids, Sam has the most to complain about, yet complains the least.” As soon as you meet Sam, you can tell that this is true. However, I realized that this is something that is so true of all miracle families. Families dealing with childhood illness or injuries, you realize that although they have the most to be angry, sad, scared, or nervous about, they’re families who show so much love and courage to let their stories be told.  It’s inspiring and leads me to my next miracle story – Holden. Before Holden was born, doctors already anticipated he would have heart problems. When he was born, it wasn’t long until Holden were to have open-heart surgery due to the heart defect he was born with. Unfortunately, at just 2 years old, Holden lost his battle and passed away. During my time being involved with Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals, Holden was the first (and only) story of a loss I had experienced. Holden’s parents are a prime example of parents who may have so much to be angry, sad, scared, or nervous about, yet they were not. I was able to attend Holden’s funeral service where Holden’s parents welcomed the community with arms wide open to honor the baby we all knew and loved. “A heart is not judged by how much it loves. It is judged by how much it is loved by others.” Holden and his family taught me that. \n\nI could go on for days with stories of families that have touched my heart. But something that I noticed is true and is my reason for giving is “you never know until you need it.” You never realize how important children’s hospitals are until you need to bring your child there. You never know how important current equipment, technology, and research are until a child’s life is depending on it. \n\nThese children being admitted to these hospitals sometimes have conditions they can’t even pronounce, much less understand. Although I have no children myself, I can imagine the amount of strength not only these kids have but their parents and families have, as well. \n\nI will forever give back to my local Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals, I will forever be For The Kids, because it’s true, you never know until you need it.

Consistent electricity (a necessity for economic development) is also a commodity that people in the US expect and even demand.  Yet a mere 800 miles Southeast of Florida, the poorest county in the Western hemisphere subsists where the majority of the population lives below the poverty line and many do not know if or when they will find clean water or food again.  Haiti is a complex nation.  Its people are proud and independent, and most would benefit greatly from a hand up, rather than a hand out. \nI am an emergency medicine physician and I recently participated in a medical mission to Haiti along with eleven other health care providers.  Three of us, including myself, brought our teenagers as well to instill a sense of dedication to public service and to expose them to situations that they would not otherwise encounter.  My two were Jonathan, 13 and Juliette, 15.  This trip was the most powerful and emotionally charged experience I have ever had, and it had a profound effect on my teens as well.  The people are extraordinary, coping with overwhelming poverty while remaining resilient.  We were able to offer a modest amount of assistance, but the situation in Haiti remains quite serious.  There is a lack of political and economic stability, infrastructure, electricity and reliable clean water and food sources.  Nonetheless, the prospect of small changes leading to compounded positive effects has inspired all of us, and we would be honored to provide further assistance to the program and community we visited through your generous donation.\nThe organization that we worked under was the Haitian Christian Mission (HCM).  We served at the medical center they created without any ties to religious endeavors.  The HCM developed and staffs the only large medical center in the region, providing both physicians and midwives to serve a population of over 80,000 regardless of religious affiliation or even ability to pay.   The HCM has also partnered with multiple other nonprofit organizations including the Labor of Love nonprofit group which helps support the midwives. In addition, the HCM also oversees numerous initiatives for the community it serves including health care, education, nutrition, and sustainability projects.  The HCM has established a school for over 3,500 children and a variety of adults as well and it is open to provide education for all regardless of religious affiliation.  They also fund an orphanage for children who lost their parents during the earthquake.  The HCM also works to promote self-sufficiency and they have created a peanut butter factory in the village that provides both food and wages to community.  The HCM is centered in a region called Fond Parisien – a small town about an hour and a half East of Port au Prince near the border of the Dominican Republic.  The organization was started by a couple, Betty and Etienne Prophete, and is now run by their son Edwens Prophete.  Our first night there, the young Mr. Prophet spoke with great vision and passion, outlining ideas for increasing self-sufficiency of the region.  \n\nOur trip was both wonderful and heartbreaking.  \nWe began the trip with a visit to the orphanage that the HCM sponsors.  Here numerous children who lost their parents in the earthquake are housed, fed, clothed and educated in school – a true luxury considering that less than half of children in Haiti receive even a primary education.  That afternoon we assisted teaching one of their English classes for the French and Creole speaking children and adults. Our team created a play using their vocabulary words and we performed it once for the students (clearly enunciating the words) then alongside the students (encouraging them to speak in English).  Then each of us worked one-on-one with them for an additional hour of instruction.  \n\nMost of the remaining days we worked in the clinic  caring for a wide variety of patients – one minute feeling exhilarated as we delivered healthy babies with moms who were in good condition, then the next feeling overwhelmed with sadness as we treated severely malnourished infants near death and mothers with significant complications of pregnancy.  The infant and maternal mortality rates in Haiti are the highest in the Western hemisphere.  We also cared for a variety of patients who had come from all over the region to the HCM’s clinic with diseases that ranged from malaria to cholera to TB and high blood pressure.  We were usually able to treat them using the limited medical therapies that were available through the HCM clinic.  We worked with little electricity, sometimes utilizing generators donated to the program that were often only available for one or two hours a night. \n\nOn the last day of our trip, we visited a nearby refugee camp for Haitian descendants that were deported from the Dominican Republic.  In this camp people lived in tents sleeping on the ground without food, clothing or clean water.  We brought numerous donations supplied by the HCM (and other we brought as well) and we played with the children who seemed happy to have a distraction from their situation.  Nothing could have prepared us for what we experienced there and it is still hard for me to put into words the emotions that followed.  More than anything, I am thankful to have been able to offer a small ray of hope to these lovely people who have suffered so much and I am grateful to the HCM for allowing me this opportunity and providing me with the experience that has left an indelible impression on me and my children.    \n\nThe people of Haiti are resilient and appreciative for all assistance – especially that which promotes independence and self – sustainability.  If we are selected for this award, I would donate the money to the HCM, the wonderful organization that welcomed us into their community and works so hard to make positive impact on their country.  I would ask that the donations be focused on a program that works to offer assistance in becoming self-sufficient or to aide in the overall health of the community.   \n\nPossible areas that I see as lending themselves best to a small donation creating a large impact are as follows:\n\n1. The new medical facility – The HCM is in the process of building a new medical facility that will provide increased services to the entire region including an emergency room as well as surgical suites and an inpatient ward.  This endeavor is already underway but could certainly use additional funding.\n2. Clean Water – A reliable clean source of drinking water would relieve a huge burden on the population that constantly spends a large proportion of their extremely limited funds for clean water, or consumes dirty water making them ill.\na. There is a novel global water purification program using a newly invented device called the Slingshot water purifier (developed by a joint venture with the Coca-Cola company and the R&D company of renowned inventor Dean Kamen).  They have created a device that uses minimal electricity that can turn almost any source (ocean water or even waste) into clean drinkable water. A single Slingshot can purify more than 250,000 liters of water per year, enough to satisfy the needs of about 300 people. And it can do so with any water source—sewage, seawater, chemical waste—no matter how dirty.\nThis system would change the entire dynamic of the village to which it is sent.  This would be an ideal donation to the village, Fond Parisien, set alongside a salt water lake named Lake Azuei.\n\n3. Farming supplies and assistance – much of Haiti has undergone diffuse deforestation, leaving flat land potentially amenable to farming. Near where we stayed, there was one small field growing corn, but most fields lay empty.  \na. The Haitians could be given the materials and instructions to develop appropriate crops to feed both their own population and eventually livestock as well.  \n\n4. Electricity – the town where we stayed had extremely limited power – mostly obtained via generators donated through charity.  The generators would run for only about an hour each evening with no electricity at all during the day.\na. The area would be the perfect setting for solar power fields.  With consistent reliable power, the community could employ workers, generate businesses, and develop an infrastructure that is not currently a possibility.\n\nI am certain that Mr. Profete and the HCM would be honored to undertake any of the above programs.  However, if religious-based organizations are not acceptable, then another non-religious nonprofit organization in Haiti called Youthaiti would be my second choice.  This group has worked to bring sanitation and sustainable food to communities in the southwestern part of the country.  Youthaiti has provided education about proper sanitation as well as farming, and has installed numerous toilets throughout the region (assisting in keeping water sources clean), while also helping communities begin region-appropriate crops for food.\n\nThis Thanksgiving I am extremely grateful for my healthy family, my work, and the life changing mission we recently experienced.  In addition, knowing that there are organizations like yours willing to donate to other nonprofits gives me hope that we may all make a difference.  It gives me enormous satisfaction to know that as we celebrate with our families in our warm, well lit homes with abundant food and drink, others in need will soon receive a new opportunity to advance themselves and their situation.  \n\nI appreciate your consideration, and whichever organization you choose, I wish the recipients well and I applaud your understanding of the true meaning of this season.  \n",,

Knowing that we can provide a safe home for a child with medical needs traveling from another country, without his or her family, is a very important role that we play in their lives.  Our love for the child becomes unconditional as we step in as Mother, Father, Sister, and Brother……Family. Being separated from their family in addition to experiencing difficult procedures and physical discomfort or pain is very scary for them. Giving them the comfort of family support during these times is a chance to be the positive support that may make all the difference in their lives. Taking care of a four year old girl in my home who is completely blind, away from her family, and speaking a different language is something that requires understanding and special attention.

It’s me!” looking into the mirror…that is the reward.

Listening to children scarred from burns on their body explain how lucky they are, and grateful for life, and these children come with no material possessions, just their open hearts and sometimes open wounds.

The 'art of medicine' that I loved had become business and billing, rather than science and people. \n \nHealth Care for All Colorado Foundation(501c3) is the research and educational arm of its 501c4, Health Care for All Colorado, which advocates and works to build the grassroots movement for single payer health care that is publicly funded.  Paying a percentage of income each year in a health care' tax', as we fund public schools, would allow everyone to pay into a health care fund that would pay all providers.  The overhead administrative costs are a fraction of what is paid now to a myriad of private insurers.  Even more important is the reassurance that no one would go without needed medical care or fear bankruptcy from reams of medical bills. Once that tax is paid, no other premiums, co-pays, deductibles or other hidden costs!  For providers, it means less time and money spent on billing procedures, and more time to listen to patients.  After experiencing and listening to so many 'health care horror stories' and seeing corporations making medical 'decisions' based on their profits, I took action.  Health care is a human right.

I am part of a Gifted Independent Study mentorship program at my school, and a major part of what we do is community outreach. My teacher, Robin Owens, set up a day for us to help organize and sort food at the Highland Food Pantry in our town. At first, I was not looking forward to it; I didn’t want to be in a cold room sorting food when I could be interacting with people and volunteering in a fun, exciting way. When we got there and met the wonderful and kind people who run the pantry, my opinion changed drastically.\nWe walked in the door and sat on the long benches in the entrance to the pantry. They started by introducing themselves as the Highland Food Pantry and running us through their schedule of providing food to those in need in our community. Then, they let us read letters from community members who have been impacted by the generosity of the food pantry. One older man had been injured and unable to work when his daughter was killed in a car accident and left her three children to him. He couldn’t care for them and take on the added responsibility of three young children. One day, he walked into the Highland Food Pantry in our small town and he cried. He felt horrible for not being able to care for his kids. The caring members of the pantry were able to give him an emergency box of food to hold him over until they could find a more permanent solution. This story, and many like it, showed me how important the pantry is for members of my local community who need help. The pantry made me realize that no matter how “boring” volunteer work can be, giving your time in any way to help people is the most important thing you can do. I’ve since returned to the pantry to unload and sort a major delivery from Family Dollar, and am planning a day to assist in serving clients.\nUnfortunately, the pantry has very limited funding. They get foods and other useful items to for their clients from the FDA, donations, and purchase a few things from local stores like Family Dollar, but this is not enough. The pantry is struggling to help all of their clients, especially as the winter holiday season approaches. It would be amazing if they could get more money to be able to serve as many people as possible for Christmas and keep all their clients in good health through the harsh winter. Everyone at the Highland Food Pantry cares immensely about improving the community, and need added support to be even more successful. Being able to give my time to such an amazing and selfless group has changed my life and made me even more aware of the power of giving.\nI give back because it makes me happy and I’m a privileged teenager with the ability to help others, so why not take advantage of the volunteer opportunities in my town, like the Highland Food Pantry.\n",,

Our goal is to provide hospitality to people at the end of life who have no loved ones or home.\n\nHaving been interested in the plight of homeless veterans everywhere, it occurred to me that many veterans were likely to be in this group of homeless.\n\nAfter meeting Karen Cassidy, the director of Hildegard House, it was obvious that she not only had a wonderful concept but also the vision, experience, and drive to make this a reality.\n\nThe final and most compelling factor for becoming involved with both time and treasure in the Hildegard House charity was an incident that my wife and I had experienced many years earlier.  The phrase “death with dignity” brought to mind an acquaintance who lived alone and died alone.  He had been dead for at least three days when he was found in his apartment with his dogs.  Being animals, they had begun to use their loyal owner as food.  If there is an antithesis to “dying with dignity”, this is it.

I set out to complete an Ironman to show cancer that it couldn’t beat me, that I can do anything I put my mind to, and to inspire others.  However I received so much more in return from this journey.   By doing an Ironman it gave me a platform to not only raise money, but also awareness for programs that helped my family and me during our battle with my cancer.  The KidsCan and Camp Kesem programs made possible by the Holt Brothers Foundation are amazing!  KidsCan helps children of parents that are battling cancer both learn about Cancer, life and death, and how to deal with it emotionally.  And Camp Kesem is a week long summer camp that only invites kids that have a parent battling cancer or has lost their life to cancer to be with others just like them and escape the day to day sadness of cancer in the family.  My two little girls went from being scared to play with others at recess, because they might give “Cancer to someone else” and not sitting near me for the same fear of “catching Cancer” to now understanding it, embracing the good lessons learned and now they continue to help other friends they meet deal with the same issues.  The experience of my journey both through battling cancer and training for an ironman has made my family and me so much stronger.  I don’t wish cancer on anyone and can’t wait until they find a cure, but until then I think it is truly important to give to foundations that help people deal with cancer.  Specifically ones that help people deal with life during your cancer battle.  We are all affected by cancer’s horrible reach.  It important to help and give to programs whose mission is to assist people in dealing with cancer as they are fighting it, as well as post cancer for surviving family members and caregivers.  Often the best form of giving is not only monetary, but through volunteering or reaching out to ones you know who are in need.  Helping can be as simple as mowing the yard, making the family a dinner, taking a child to sports practice, or hanging out with them during a chemo session.  Any form helps and will mean more than you could ever imagine.  I found it difficult to accept help when I was going through chemo, radiation, and surgeries.  I didn’t want to let cancer think I was weak and needed any help, but I quickly learned that it did not make me weak, but made me stronger than I could ever imagine simply by letting others help and support in any way they desired.

After interviewing with several agencies for my practicum placement, I chose HomePlate– the only outreach team and drop-in resource center for youth experiencing housing instability in Washington County. HomePlate is special because they are a low-barrier, safe space for youth in the community to access necessary resources like a hot meal, shower, clothes, job resources, tutoring and more. \n\nMy favorite moments have come from Wednesday night drop-ins when I get to share a meal and provide homework tutoring for the youth. Early in October, one of the girls asked me to help her with a persuasive essay. As I was reading over it, she told me English was her second language, and her teacher had set a goal for her to improve from 5th grade to high school writing level by the end of the school year. We worked tirelessly on the essay together and after three weeks of work, she turned in her paper and got an A. The way she persevered through learning to write a persuasive essay in a second language serves as an inspiration to me. It’s these seemingly simple moments of joy which have meant the most to me.\n\nWhen asked, “What does HomePlate mean to you?” One of our youth responded, ““HomePlate cares for you and helps you find jobs and if you are having troubles they make sure they help you.” I couldn’t summarize it better, myself.

However, #MyGivingStory shows the difference that ordinary people like me can make in the face of challenges, impacting the lives of others and inspiring others to rally around a cause. My inspiration to give started at home and grew to encompass a whole community of people who are disenfranchised by society—people with developmental disabilities.\nMy son, Alex, was born with developmental disabilities. In 2004, he was about to “age out” of special education, and my wife, Ruthie, and I struggled to find options that allowed him to continue to develop his abilities and remain in the community. Finally, our search brought us to Hope Services, a Bay Area-based nonprofit organization that provides programs and services to individuals with developmental disabilities of all ages. We were delighted with what we found at Hope—staff that were professional and compassionate, and, most importantly, programs that involved clients in the community through paid and volunteer work, recreational outings, and educational trips to places that clients needed to learn to navigate, like the grocery store or bank. Unfortunately, we live in the small town of Half Moon Bay, and the closest Hope program was an hour away in San Jose—too far out of Alex’s comfort zone and too long of a drive to be realistic for my wife and I. However, we weren’t ready to give up on Alex, or on Hope. So, we decided to launch a Hope program right at home, where Alex would feel comfortable and be able to become integrated into his own community, and our neighbors with developmental disabilities could find a compassionate, community-oriented place to reach their full potential.\nAlthough starting Hope Services’ Half Moon Bay program was no easy feat, once I experienced giving back to the community and impacting the lives of others with developmental disabilities and their families, I was hooked. Ruthie and I became regular donors to Hope, since we soon realized the organization needed financial support as well as volunteer support in order to provide its much-needed services. In 2007, I amplified my volunteer efforts by joining the Board of Directors of Hope, becoming Chair in 2014.\nThe more I began to mobilize the community around Hope’s mission to improve the lives of individuals with developmental disabilities, the more I realized an important thing about most people: they want to give back in whatever way they can, whether by making a donation, participating in a walkathon, or lending a helping hand. Therefore, I decided to give my employees at my business, Commercial Casework, the opportunity to incorporate philanthropy into their professional lives.  Each year, they are allowed to take time off to volunteer, organize volunteer days, and initiate fundraising drives for the nonprofits we support..  Far from detracting from Commercial Casework’s quality of work, I have found that bringing philanthropy into the workplace improves employees’ morale, helping to increase productivity and retain talented workers.  In fact, I would encourage any business owner to consider including some sort of charitable activity in their work—when entrepreneurs and employees feel the work they are doing is making a difference, they improve both their own lives and the community around them—a win-win situation for all.\nI hope #MyGivingStory shows that you don’t have to be a billionaire or superhero to have a real impact on the lives of others. All you need is a cause you care about, a fair bit of elbow grease, and the courage to try. I also hope you will check out the great work Hope is doing at www.hopeservices.org: I know advocating for society’s acceptance of people with disabilities has become my passion and, once you see the tremendous things Hope’s clients are doing, it might become yours, too.\n",,

We have created several high school and college clubs, hosted numerous fundraising and awareness events, and built a team of passionate individuals to champion our cause. The investments at our partner schools have paid off too: test scores have increased, school rankings have soared, teacher to student ratios have decreased, graduation rates have improved, and enrollment in secondary schools has increased. \n\nThis past summer I had the opportunity to hear a story of one of the lives that we have impacted. I met a grandmother of one of the students that we sponsored. She shared that she had searched for months for support for her granddaughter but all was in vain.

I’m aware of the amazing humanitarian agencies who fight Ebola, conduct search/rescue or provide relief to countless people around the globe after disasters. They’re on TV every day. They inspire me.\n\nAnd…we’re probably ALL aware that:\n\nHundreds of disasters every year kill almost 100,000 people. They impact another 200 million more.\n\nBehind the news is something that I didn’t know. (Maybe you don’t, either?) In fact, I probably still wouldn’t. I’m a retiree, mother and grandmother who’s sort of a humanitarian at heart. But--I have a son educated in the “techie” world who gave up his astoundingly high salary to follow his heart into international humanitarian work. \n\nHere’s what I didn’t know:\n\nTo fight Ebola, conduct search & rescue after disasters, or provide relief services, agencies like Doctors Without Borders or Red Cross International need detailed maps of villages and other places where people live. \n\nBut, there’s a problem: Many places where disaster strikes do not exist on ANY map! So…how do teams locate unmapped villages…how do they find people?\n\nI had no idea that there’s an amazing worldwide team that works every day on a solution to this very problem! And it has a name. It’s the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team. That’s kind of a long name. So, people “in the know” affectionately refer to this community as “HOT.” (Yup—they’re HOTTIES…)\n\nWhat does HOT actually do?\n\nWhen disaster strikes, HOT mobilizes a global network—thousands of amazing volunteers. Using an editable map called OpenStreetMap, they team up and work tirelessly to create online maps of affected areas. Then, groups like Doctors Without Borders, the Red Cross and numerous humanitarian teams rely on the maps that HOT creates, especially in places previously unmapped.\n\nAnd that’s not all I learned.\n\nNot just in the event of a catastrophe, but EVERY DAY, dedicated HOT volunteers are working in many countries to put our world’s most vulnerable places and people on the map BEFORE disaster strikes. \n\nA great example is HOT’s Missing Maps project, which benefits from the tireless work of wonderful volunteers around the globe. Missing Maps has put 8 million people on the map!\n\n4,000 volunteers have helped HOT makeover 13 million edits to OpenStreetMap!\n\nWhen Nepal was devastated by an earthquake, 7,000 contributors added 13 million objects to the map!\n\nWe don’t hear about HOT in the news. HOT is made up of quiet dynamos--amazing, caring, passionate people giving freely of their time and energy to be their brothers’ and sisters’ keepers. HOT is made up of a principled, humanitarian executive director, a small global board of directors, limited staff, and thousands of volunteers. They stretch their resources for enormous impact.\n\nPlease “Like!”\n\nWho knew about humanitarian mapping? Now I do. That’s why I gave and will donate again to the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team. Please join me and, if you can’t donate, please just click “Like.”  HOT deserves our support!\n",,

There I was dreaming about the college life like most teenagers around my age. I was excited about the next four years of my life; four years that I would spend studying at the University of Rhode Island. Even better, I was scheduled to live in a dorm along with my two best friends. Apart from that, I was excited about the opportunity of living on my own, away from home and the rules of my parent.          Then the academic year began, I was a freshman, who had many dreams; dreams of getting a degree, becoming successful and eventually being able to provide for my family. Little did I know that my emerging dreams would soon fall short. One early morning in late September, I got out of bed and proceeded to start the day. Like any other day, I first went to the bathroom to brush my teeth. I took a quick glance at the mirror and to my surprise; I noticed some unfamiliar features all over my face. After further observation, I realized that it was just a patch of rash that had colonized both sides of my cheeks. In hope that it’ll disappear sooner than later, I thought of the rash as being nothing serious. I couldn’t have been anymore wrong.  The once overlooked rash, began to take a toll on me as it spread all over my face. Confused and concerned, I took a day out of school to visit my doctor. My doctor saw the symptoms and said that it was poison ivy. She went on to prescribe me a corticosteroid called Prednisone to suppress the inflammation. So I did as the doctor recommended. As I weaned off of the medication my rash would reappear in multiple quantities; more severe than the last time. I began to experience more symptoms including, itching, and the expansion of the rash. The rash began to spread on my arms plus my whole face was covered with bumps.        At this point, I began to lose confidence in all aspects of life. I was frightened because I’ve never been this sick in my life. At the same time, I decided to leave campus after just a month of classes. My doctor was so concerned that she recommended that I go to the “best” Dermatologist in Rhode Island. So I went to see the Doctor who comforted me, and expressed his familiarity of the condition. Unknown to my knowledge at the time, I was prescribed the same medication as my previous doctor. I took the medication, however, when it was time to cut back on its use, the effects were brutal. My face got swollen and I started to notice cuts on my skin. I started to see scales behind my ears, my eyes were swollen, and my arms had large bumps all over them. He continued to prescribe the medication in high doses and each time I needed to wean down, the symptoms were more severe than the last time. I can’t believe how clueless I was about that medication at the time. How dangerous that medication was and at such high doses! I lasted a few months on that medication when it is usually prescribed for no more than two weeks especially on doses of 60mg and 40 mg. During these months I demanded that we get to what is causing this rash, instead of masking it with medication. If this rash began out of nowhere, obviously there was an underlying issue. They then tested me for different chemicals to see if I was allergic to any them. The results were negative! I began to think it was the environment around me. So I bought an air purifier, put wood floors and took out the carpet in the room, shut the vents, etc. I was literally going crazy because I had no idea what was causing it. All the money I saved from high school was gone in a few weeks.  The other test that the doctors did, was a skin prick test where they test for different plants, dust, mold and dander and t to see I was allergic to them. And to my astonishment, I was allergic to literally every single plant that they tested for on my skin! Some plants I reacted to worse than others. Since these were the only results that we had, it was the only one that we worked with so I spent my time indoors to keep away from everything that I was allergic to, basically living my life in my own prison cell that I called my home. At this time, I was still on the medication that was keeping my symptoms somewhat under control. I decided to get off of the medication because it was never addressing what was causing it. If it was up to the “Best” Dermatologist, I would have continued to be on the medication till this day. I finally got off the medication and what happened to my body when I got off was something unimaginable. My whole face was swollen. My eyes were so swollen that I could barely see. I had bumps covering my whole face, my arms, my thighs and my chest. I had gashes behind my ears, and cuts literally all around my eyes, my mouth and my arms. The dryness of my face caused the cuts and it hurt so bad to move any part of those areas. I could barely open my mouth because of the cuts on my lips. I was extremely terrified of what my face and body had become. My family was beyond worried. I went to the doctors with a rash and I left with this. I thank god that my family was there to support me. They put Vaseline all over the cuts and dry areas. They made me soups and easily digestible foods. They comforted me emotionally since I was in so much need for it at the time. I spent over two months on the bed literally unable to care for myself. When I began to get my vision back and the swelling went down a little bit I began to start my research on a doctor who can help me. I would wake up and spend my whole day on a computer. My nights were spent scratching my face and arms due to the severe itching. I would spend hours scratching my face and arms causing more and more cuts and gashes. I hated to see my fingertips filled with flesh and blood from the scratching.  One of my family members would stay up with me during my scratching sessions for emotional support because I really needed it. I would only go out for doctor visits. And EVERY single doctor that I went to told me that I would never get my life back, I would forever have to suffer like this and I would never look the same. Every single rejection hit me so hard, but I never gave up, because I knew that there was something out there that would eventually help me. As the months went by, the itching got more and more severe. The itching would last for about 6-7 hours every single night. I would wake up, put alcohol on all my new cuts (such a painful process) and get on my computer and keep searching for an answer. My family was spending all of their money on my medical bills and I felt so terrible. I felt like this was my fault and they would be better off without me there. While I was dealing with this, many things happened that put me in an even worse emotional state. My girlfriend of almost two years left me when I needed her the most; I went to the Emergency Room 3-4 times due to the wounds I was producing from the scratching. All of the medications that I was prescribed for the itching did not work. I tried every single diet out there. Whether it was the Ketogenic, Vegan, Vegetarian, etc diet, they did not work. I was extremely scared to eat since some foods were causing more itching than others.  I was losing so much weight because of the eating disorder I had developed. Most of the “friends” that I had never came to visit me. It would be a battle just to take a shower because the water on the cuts stung so badly. This was a lot for an 18 year old. About eight months in I just stopped eating so I can get a break from the itching. I was so scared to eat or drink anything, that I literally just drank water the entire time. I lost so much weight during this time, I had such low energy that I could not even be on the computer; I just laid in bed all day. My family was devastated about everything that was happening in my life and how it was happening so fast. They wished that they could help somehow but no one knew where to go. While I was fasting, I needed help to do everything. I could not get up by myself, nor put on clothes or take a shower by myself. The fasting seemed to have worked and I was given a temporary relief from the illness. After the seventh day I could not take it anymore. I was so hungry that I cannot explain it in words. When I began to eat again the itching came back. I slowly lost hope and it was getting to a point where I couldn’t take the pain and suffering anymore, but I still continued to search online for an answer. I cried many nights, but thankfully my family once again, was always there to support me. \n A year and 2 months into the illness, I finally stumbled upon a page that talked about Functional Medicine. Functional Medicine focuses on getting to the root cause of chronic illness instead of treating the symptoms like Conventional Medicine does. I was scared and excited to have found out about this medicine. Scared because I just could not imagine my life going back to what it used to be, it was a dream to me. Excited because maybe my dream can come true and I wouldn’t have to suffer anymore. Desperate at the time, I scheduled an appointment with the nearest Functional Medicine doctor. The appointment was in two weeks and the initial consultation was 300$. It hurt me so bad that my family had to spend more money on my chronic illness but they did not care even though I knew it was taking a toll on them. I recall telling my mother one night, one week till the appointment, something important. It was five o’clock in the morning and I had been scratching my face and arms for about six hours. I had many new cuts and gashes due to the scratching and I told my mother that I couldn’t take it anymore. I lost everything in my life and there was really no point to live. My life consisted of being on a computer searching for an answer and itching all night. It finally took its toll on my mental health and I just couldn’t handle it. The hopelessness and despair was too much for me.  I told her if this doctor doesn’t help me I couldn’t live this life anymore. I couldn’t take another rejection of a doctor or another month of itching. I was sick of hearing that my illness was “rare”. I was tired of my family putting hot towels on my face and body until the itching subsided. My mother was extremely saddened by what I told her but deep down she knew I was right. So finally it is the day of the appointment. It was about an hour and a half away. I was just praying that they’ll find something. This was my last shot. So we finally get to the place and wait for our name to be called. It gets called and we go to the room that the secretary told us to go to. We sit down and there’s a doctor waiting for us. She tells us to take a seat and asks us what brings us there. My mother starts to explain everything that has been happening the past year in detail. I couldn’t speak because I became too emotional to speak.  I couldn’t speak because of the pain and depression that overwhelmed me. I just sat there, broke down and looked to the floor. My mother told her about all the doctors I have gone to and how they couldn’t figure out what was causing my rashes and the itching. The doctor was told about how I’ve tried all the diets and testing that conventional medicine had to offer. The doctor was extremely nice and explained to us about the tests that she recommends I take to get to find the root cause. We would just pay her and she will order the tests for us. The tests included an array of stool, saliva and urine kits. I went home and got samples of each for the kits. We sent them to the laboratory and it took about a month to get the results back. It was a terrible month waiting for the results but I pushed through because I still had a small amount of hope. Finally, the results came back and it turns out I had a severe parasitic infection and fungal overgrowth. They prescribed me the correct medication and it took about two months for the itching to subside but many more months to get my body where it needed to be because it had a lot of things wrong with it. Eventually I was able to get a job and buy supplements with my own money. I was extremely grateful for a second chance at life. I couldn’t believe it was all over and at the perfect time. I got a job at Sears and was able to work full time. I remember one day at work, when it was empty and I had nothing to do, I went to the back where they keep extra items, and just sat and relaxed on a ladder nearby. I sat on the ladder and just thought about everything I went through. I got very emotional and I got up, wiped my eyes and decided I wanted to dedicate my life to helping people. I wanted to be that person that I didn’t have. I wanted to show the sufferer exactly where to go to find the answers to their illness. I wouldn’t have suffered so massively if someone had been there pointing me in the right direction ,which is what I want to do for others. I first decided to create a Youtube video sharing my experience and pictures of how I looked like. I started to speak to people around the world going through the same thing I was originally going through. They were extremely grateful for my information and happy that I was better. The problem was that most of them did not have the money for the testing. I spent over 4000$ on the testing and supplements since the insurance doesn’t cover the costs. I am still paying the debt since it was on my grandmother’s credit card. So I tried to think of a way where I can pay for their supplements, consultation fees, and Laboratory testing. I finally decided to start a non-profit organization. I got an attorney to help me with all of the paperwork of the 1023 forms and other needed paperwork. She actually did it for free so I was truly blessed. I saved 3500$ to 5000$ with her service. We sent the paperwork to the IRS and waited for their response. It took about three to four months for a response. I was able to enroll back into school and when I came home from class one day I seen a letter from the IRS. I anxiously opened it and it said that my organization was tax exempt. It was definitely a great moment in my life. So what I am doing right now is saving up to buy cameras. What we’re going to do is film someone suffering with a severe skin problem. We are going to pay 500$ to a friend to create our website.  We’re going to make the video appeal to the viewers emotions, and pay 1500$ to put it on Worldstarhiphop.com. Worldstarhiphop.com is a content video blog that averages 1.1 million users a day. Worldstarhiphop will give us the platform we need to continue helping people. I have already contacted the website and this is the pricing they gave us. I have friends who know grant writers personally and said when we get the money to pay them; we will be able to have them write grants for us. We will also use the money to help pay for the laboratory testing of our first sufferer. It is hard for us to do this right now because we are enrolled in college. We have the plan, we just need the money. We are currently saving for the cameras but we’d greatly appreciate it if we can receive the money to give us the platform to help people around the world. Our organization is called I’m Cured Inc. EIN: 47-2378920 . I just thank God each and every day for my life right now. I truly believe everything happens for a reason. And I know that he will help me find a way to helping millions of people suffering from skin conditions all over the world.       \n   \n",,

We spent time and straightened her house a bit, she was poor so did not have much.  We sat and talked with her, she reached out and held my hand and said I saved her life.

I could tell that if she was without any health challenges that she would be just a normal kid with a lot of spunk! On my 5th day there, I decided to go and spend more time with her. It warmed my heart as she reached for me, and I was able to hold and chat with her for most of the day. As she was in my arms, I was led by God to begin praying for her “Destiny.” The way she arrived to SCH was heartbreaking but God has such a great plan for her life and for her future. “For I know the plans I have for you,” Declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.” Jeremiah 29:11\nThe moment I began praying, my eyes welled with tears because I knew that Destiny was the one.

Someday came sooner than he thought. The following week I asked if he would take tango lessons with me. That was pretty much it. Dancing became a new passion we shared together.\nAt our wedding three years later, we danced an Argentine tango to La Cumparsita for our First Dance. It was a special dance for a very special day. Most couples will agree that marriage holds many challenges. Our first challenge came early on. During our honeymoon in Hawaii, my husband slipped and fell, sustaining a spinal cord stroke. He became paralyzed from the waist down, permanently.\nThe full extent of that loss slowly sank in during the months following the accident. Things that use to be easy to do, now took 4 times longer. Whether that was putting on a pair of pants or getting out of the car. Forget about going over to a friend’s house: stairs, narrow doorways, tiny bathrooms. Dancing the tango again? No way.\nAfter dreaming for 12 years of one day dancing with my husband, we found Marisa and her seedling nonprofit called Infinite Flow-A Wheelchair Dance Company http://www.infiniteflowdance.org/.\nI was so excited! Marisa is a dancer who had been temporarily paralyzed from the neck down with a rare spinal cord disease. After recovering and establishing herself as a professional ballroom dancer and instructor, she made it her mission to share the power of dance with others who are seemingly bound by their wheelchairs. Infinite Flow is showing the world that anyone can dance, especially someone in a wheelchair. And this is partner dancing, not just individual dancing. What that means to me is that I can tango with my husband once again. Bring on the ochos! In Infinite Flow’s classes, a wheelchair dancer is paired up with an ambulatory dancer and we learn how to lead and follow with rhythm, just like any ballroom dance class.\nInfinite Flow brought dancing back into our lives. It opened our minds to other activities we thought we would never be able to do again. Dancing makes us happy. It’s great exercise, and we’ve made so many great friends through these classes. If dancing did this for us, maybe it could do the same for someone else. For all these reasons, we chose to make a contribution to Infinite Flow.",,

I loved to sing, and saw no reason to not enter my grade school talent show (even thought I was only in Kindergarten). I got on stage in front of the entire school and sang the ever-so-popular children’s song, “Mr. Sun”.  I didn’t realize it then, but this was an important moment in my, one that actually defined many of my latter years. I continued to sing anywhere and everywhere that I could through my adolescent years; karaoke, family nights at local bars and restaurants, and more. Many years, and many blank cassette tapes later, I learned what it meant to truly have a passion for something. I came from a single parent home. My mom worked long hours, and multiple jobs just to make ends meet. Extracurricular activities that weren’t funded by the public school system, were unfortunately something that seemed unattainable for me, so as badly as I wanted to take music lessons, I didn’t want to burden my mom with adding more financial responsibility to her plate. I know if I had asked she would have bent over backwards to make it happen, but I never did. \nAround the age of 15, my best friend’s mother introduced me to a relatively new local music program, who luckily for me, provided scholarship opportunities to cover lesson fees. I remember walking into the building, meeting some of the instructors and students, and having a voice scream out to me, “this is where you need to be.” So I gathered the registration paperwork, the scholarship application, and my excitement, and took them home. I began voice lessons the very next week. \nThis was another one of those moments that you don’t realize define you until much later in life. I was a student of the Infinity Performing Arts Program (now the Infinity Visual and Performing Arts Center) from 2002-2008. During this time, I was given opportunities that the 5-year old me could have only dreamed of. I performed on stages at the Center, in the community, at local and regional events, County and regional fairs, and even the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I was given the opportunity to work on two studio-recorded albums, one alongside members of the 10,000 Maniacs.

With scrappy determination, I promised to become a first-generation graduate of a four-year university despite being continually bullied through middle school for being the smart kid.

There was no good excuse for it. I had an excellent upbringing, I have a college degree, I had had a career in public relations, but then several things happened at once - I quit working, my mother died, I let my clinical depression go unchecked and  untreated and simply lost all my savings, then my home, then my belongings. The only thing I had left was my pride, which isolated me from my friends and family and prevented me from getting the help I needed.\n\nOddly enough, it wasn't the possessions or the stability I missed most - it was the fact that I didn't feel like I was contributing. I wasn't using my talents, and I wasn't donating to things which had always been important to me. I wasn't even volunteering.\n\nI finally got help, entered a shelter run by Inter-Faith Ministries, started taking an anti-depressant, reached out to people and began the long journey back to a productive, happy life. \n\nThe staff at Inter-Faith Ministries might have saved my life. They provided support and friendship when I was still unwilling to involve my friends and family in my 'shame.' They then gave me a job - I started working in one of the homeless shelters as a house manager, something I still do one day a week in spite of the fact that I now work full time as Marketing Coordinator for the organization. While the marketing gig is exciting and certainly in line with my talents and education, I enjoy working with the residents in the shelter too much to stop. I also like to think that my story can help some of them get over the despair and shame of homelessness and regain their lives.\n\nOne of my proudest moments was when I was financially able to begin contributing financially again. My first step was to reinstate my monthly pledge with the local public radio station. That came before I even bought a bed because giving to and supporting others was more important to me in my road back to a 'normal' life than getting my mattress off the floor!\n\nI still don't advertise the fact that I have been homeless. I recently gave a talk to a group that included a couple people who had known me 25 years ago when I worked at the symphony. While it was great to catch up with them - and while it was great to hear them both say they really missed me and were so glad to know I was working with Inter-Faith - I didn't announce that it was because they had housed me for a year while I become whole again. There will always be some shame that I allowed this to happen to myself.\n\nInter-Faith Ministries, while it focuses on services for homeless and low-income people (three shelters, 104 low-income apartments, lunch program, holiday food/coat/toy distribution) also, as its name implies, brings together different faith groups. The organization has been around for 130 years and has always strived to celebrate both the diversity and the similarities of various religions. I like that in one day I can work and talk with Catholics, Hindus, evangelical Christians, Muslims and agnostics. \n\nWe do it on a shoestring budget. We have a wish list a mile long - improvements to our shelters, which all suffer from inadequate kitchens, plumbing and broken beds. We want to start a produce garden to use for meal preparation and to give our residents the opportunity to help and perhaps learn a marketable skill.

One meeting at a conference led to a cascade of events that has since had a significant impact on my scientific research, collaborations, and colors virtually everything I do. \n\nI am inspired to give my time and money by people that do or want to do the unexpected. For 99.99% of the population it would be something that is virtually impossible to do. Jill Wood as the co-founder of Jonah's Just Begun described to me back in November 2011, doing just this, pulling together the knowledge, scientists and funds so that she could catalyze research into her son Jonah's rare disease called Sanfilippo syndrome. In the years since, Jill went further, she started to have the same impact on other closely related diseases, and together this led us to found a company as an additional way to go after National Institutes of Health funding for the research performed at academic institutions. \n\nHow many parents could do all this one might ask? Jill introduced me to another parent with a rare disease foundation called Hannah’s Hope Fund (who has funded a gene therapy and brought it to clinical trial), and in turn she introduced me to yet another rare disease parent who started the Hereditary Neuropathy Foundation. All of them are parents, not scientists I might add, doing the seemingly impossible, scouring the world to find research that could catalyze a treatment to be developed. How could this not inspire you to help and donate your time and money to all their causes? At the same time it made me recalibrate what was possible. A little time and money devoted to their causes could go a long way.\n\nEvery November I remember that moment that kicked it off, Jill sitting across from me describing a heart wrenching story every parent would dread, being told her child had a fatal disease. Now every scientist I meet I tell them the same story and it leads to new connections, scientists I should meet, compounds to test and more. We are not alone in wanting our research to be funded, to succeed, to be published, and to be shared for the benefit of humankind. While at times it may seem what we do is far removed from the clinic, thousands of parents of children with rare diseases depend on us and our skills. Many scientists will not realize the importance of what we can offer until they meet people like Jill, for whom nothing is impossible. We can directly help rare disease parents and families in varied ways by giving our time, our advice, our financial support and letting them know that they are not alone in their quest for a cure. I have done all of these and it has changed me and what I do. Nothing is impossible or unattainable, we work hard, and we find people that can help us achieve the goal.\n\nSupporting and giving to rare disease foundations like Jonah’s Just Begun, Hannah’s Hope Fund and the Hereditary Neuropathy Foundation can have positive unintended consequences. It can alter your perspective on what is truly important in life. It may even change your career, lead to a new business idea, create jobs, develop products, and hopefully cure the disease. If one person leading each foundation could make all this happen over and over again then our giving either in time, expertise or money can be a powerful multiplier that creates giving stories that demand sharing repeatedly and provides hope for the families who are living with these diseases.\n",,

Joy's House is a nonprofit organization housing women and children in North Alabama. Founded in 2012, Joy's House has housed 22 residents since opening their doors.

Working with broken and battered women, those in addiction, those who have been marginalized by sex trafficking, those enticed to a new state by the empty promises of an online romance, has always been on the hearts of the family. \n\nGod is on the move at Joy's House.

We have seen those with learning disabilities become nursing assistants. The abused begin to trust again and enter into faithful loving marriages. We have performed two funerals, stood up as the mother of the bride in one wedding, been called mom and dad and countless other blessings that God lets us in on each day. \n\nWomen coming to Joy's House pay no entry fee or monthly rent.

Many had lost fathers, mothers, or brothers and sisters. All of them had lost their homes. Despite the ugliness they have witnessed, they yearned to learn, to play, and to smile.

You read about them in the paper and listen to them on the news but it just sounds like words until it really happens.  I received a phone call one night from a friend with a child with autism.

I was a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant who had long ago abandoned my family heritage as a Christian. I had always had a respect and fascination for His Holiness the Dalai Lama, but seeing Tibetan Buddhism in the flesh – with all its colors and statues and rituals – I wasn’t quite sure it fit either. Doubts quieted when I first heard the spiritual director of the temple speak about what it means to be a Buddhist. Words clung to me like static: compassion, loving kindness, we don’t judge people for their religious beliefs. I was listening. \n\nNot many weeks after my first encounter, I learned that my father was dying. Crushed by the news and desperate for direction, I fled to the temple. What do I do? How do I help him die? Who do I pray to so that he doesn’t suffer? I did not know these people yet. They didn’t know me. I hadn’t donated more than a few dollars so far – they owed me nothing. All the same, a monk named Gonpo sat and cried with me as I said the words, “My dad is dying” out loud for the first time. We became bonded. We became family.\n\nThe time came just six months later, and I was scared and sad, but prepared.

A renewed sense of optimism for the human condition and the knowledge that goals of this nature are achievable being just a few of the things I gained from the trip.

By this time in 2016, I will be a registered nurse and volunteering annually with LearnToLive not only as a filmmaker, but as a health professional as well. \n\nTo say volunteering with LearnToLive changed by life is a massive understatement, especially when you consider that I met the man that just became my husband on the second Indonesian Health Initiative in 2013!

In short, he cannot see and will be on medication for the rest of his life. \n Through the internet, I got in touch with Lighthouse Central Florida. They are the only resource available for blind and visually impaired individuals in this area. Within a week of contacting them, Lighthouse had assessed Liam’s vision and set him up to receive therapy every week at no charge. Liam’s mentor from Lighthouse has been with him for two and half years and has helped him to walk, talk, jump, play catch, and sing songs. All of which he was never expected to do. I have seen firsthand the tireless dedication of every person who works with Lighthouse. I am beyond grateful for what they have helped Liam achieve. But more than that, I have been deeply touched and inspired by the sense of family Lighthouse holds so dear. So I made a choice. I would not mourn the diagnosis that brought me and Liam to Lighthouse. Instead, I would do everything I could think of to support and encourage my Lighthouse family. And, turns out, I could think of some really fun stuff.\n Last winter I had a brilliant idea. I would take 300 middle school students, blindfold them, and set them loose in a field. On top of that, I would provide them with games. But not just any games. I’d arm these 13 year olds—hyper on life and being able to miss a class period-- with markers, water balloons, and raw eggs. We set up stations for the kids to complete a task (like throwing a water balloon or finding their own shoes mixed into a big pile) with either no vision or partial vision goggles. It could have been-- and, realistically, should have been-- a disaster of epic proportions. But it wasn’t. Instead, those kids were challenged to experience the world in a completely different way. They made Braille cards and bookmarks and were stunned when our guest speaker could read them “even though he doesn’t have eyes, Ms. Vasani!” Our field day combined two of my favorite things—charity fundraising and an opportunity for authentic learning.\n Since then, Liam and I have shot video for Lighthouse (in which he was a total ham for the camera). We’ve organized a community wide clothing drive for a Lighthouse fundraising event. I speak regularly to potential donors and at business disability awareness trainings sharing Liam’s story. We’ve been in the top 5 fundraising teams for the annual Sight and Sole walk every year. And this year, I am so excited to say that with the help of my middle school minions—I mean, students—we are converting over 70 children’s books into Braille and tactile books for blind kids. Hopefully, we will have them ready for the holidays. My students can’t wait to present them to families who may not have modified books for their children and read (yes! 8th graders who want to read!) to other children they have never met. I am so grateful that, because of Lighthouse, I can help others realize that the biggest gift is in the giving. \n      Please visit www.lighthousecentralflorida.org for more information on this wonderful nonprofit!",,

Through Lighthouse, we not only found a great support system in the staff but a community of parents and grandparents that could relate to the challenges you face with a child who is legally blind or completely blind. \n\nLighthouse Central Florida not only serves families, it employs adults who have grown up with the organization and works with the community to see the talented resources a human being has versus the challenges of blindness.

It was 'Nonprofits Day,' and many organizations were out tabling for volunteers and donations. I've never been able to resist a puppy when I see one, and Lulu's sweet face was just calling out to me from across the way. This beautiful eight year old Newfoundland-Sharpei mix laid in the shade quietly with a green bandana around her neck next to this table filled with pictures of happy dogs and signs saying 'Adopt Me.' \n\nWhen I first began volunteering for Lily's Legacy Senior Dog Sanctuary, Lulu's body was still patchy, missing large amounts of hair all over. She had medicated wipes and ointments in her eyes every day, and was on a strict diet, but her demeanor was happy as ever. When she had first come to Lily's Legacy, her stomach was like leather, just completely hairless. Over the months, I watched as she went from completely uninterested in walks or exercising to waiting by the door for her chance to get outside and explore. I watched as she began to regrow hair and as her eyes slowly got better. 5 months later, I watched as her new mom took her to her new forever home.\n\nLulu had lost out on many potential adopters because she was a senior large breed dog; her food and medicine were not cheap and she still needed someone to give her the wipes and ointments every day to keep her in the healthy shape she had grown into since being taken in at the sanctuary. Senior large breed dogs are perceived to be the most unadoptable kind of dog. Large breed dogs require more financial investment than smaller breed dogs; older dogs don't have as much play in them; a puppy will be around for longer; the reasons go on.\n\nLily's Legacy Senior Dog Sanctuary is a nonprofit organization located in Northern California that is dedicated to helping senior large breed dogs. Lily's Legacy was founded by executive director Alice Mayn in memory of Lily, a 14-year-old golden retriever she had fostered. Lily was found wandering the streets of Santa Rosa and brought to the Sonoma County Animal Shelter in November 2007. She had a host of health problems, including a very bad nasal infection and a tumor on her eyelid. Over the next four months, Lily and Alice together battled and survived the tumor removal, the infection, canine bloat, and even a seizure. When she passed away after developing a blood disorder in February 2008, Alice saw the sanctuary as a mission from Lily; a place where many of the senior dogs who are lost, abandoned, or otherwise find themselves homeless, will have a safe haven in which to live out their days, or stay until a loving adoptive home is found, and where they will receive the love and care they so richly deserve.  \n\nSome of our dogs are owner-surrenders; others are last-minute rescues from shelters who don't have room and don't think the dog is adoptable - we take in these dogs before they are put down by the shelter. Aside from daily care and TLC, Lily's Legacy provides regular veterinary care and anything else needed to nurse a dog back into health. \n\nCruz, the border collie in the photo, was also at the sanctuary when I started volunteering at Lily's Legacy. He was friendly, playful, and so smart. The volunteers were warned not to pull him or grab him by the collar, as he had issues with people touching his neck. His last owner had also been warned of this, but neglected to keep this in mind when handling him, and ended up returning him after Cruz got tired of it. One too many times and Cruz scraped his arm a little bit. But we didn't mind. We were always mindful of Cruz's reactions to us and his interactions with us. \n\nCruz was the dog that convinced my husband to get allergy shots, but we were not able to adopt him because our lease did not allow pets. When we went back to New Jersey for Christmas, Cruz was adopted again. We were sad we did not get to say goodbye to him, but things happen for a reason and we were happy for Cruz. When Cruz’s adopter passed away this spring, we jumped at the chance to adopt him ourselves. We moved to a bigger house, but by this point, Cruz had two more almost-bite run-ins - all 3 were circumstances because someone was trying to pull him by the collar off a bed or couch - and was about to be put down.\n\nWe simply could not let this happen. We asked Lily's Legacy to put a hold on everything while we convinced them and our new landlord to let us adopt Cruz. One of the stipulations of the adoption was that we work with him and a trainer on his issues. To this day, Cruz has been nothing but amazing with us. We never yell at him for barking or growling, because that's how he tells us he's uncomfortable or scared. And we never yell at him for playing with us or giving us kisses, because that's how he tells us he loves us and trusts us. He just doesn't get couch or bed privileges. \n\nCruz has become such a big part of our family; we can’t imagine our lives without him.  He is the sweetest dog and is always ready to cuddle or play ball with us.  Cruz fit into our hearts like a missing puzzle piece. More than that, the Lily's Legacy group has become the family and community we needed after moving 3000 miles across the country. They provided the support and courage for us to step up to the plate and take Cruz in. We are truly thankful that we have found such a wonderful organization that cares so much and inspires us to be the people our dog thinks we are.",,

She never turned to her name, yet she ran to the TV the second it was turned on. She had repetitive gross motor movements that never seemed to stop. We grew worried. I talked to her doctor at 14 months. That's the first time I heard the word Autism. We began a million tests. Hearing tests, Early Intervention testing, more tests and evaluations than a parent could fathom. At 20 months old, Benelli was diagnosed Autism Spectrum Disorder. I felt lost. I didn't know anyone with Autism. Where would I go? What would I do? How would I do the right things for her? It was lonely, isolating, I grieved. On February 1, 2013, around all the beginning stages of Benelli's testing, her sister Adeline was born at 4:52 pm. Adeline seemed to attend more than Benelli had as a child. Then, we began to introduce foods and she would vomit. She would eat nothing. At the age of 6 months she began repeatedly hitting herself. I became scared. Adeline began her evaluations and testing at 8 months. At that time I felt like a pro, we began therapies for her as well.

My mom was a tremendous person who had a profound impact in my life. \nThe sixth of twelve children, she was born in 1947 into a poor family in a rural part of Jamaica.  The reality of her surroundings – a tiny one-room house, no electricity or running water, walking miles bare feet to school on dirt roads – made her dream to one day become financially independent and in a position to help others - monumental.  My mom attended Seaview Primary School over 50 years ago and she fought hard to create a better future for herself – moving to the U.S. at age 22; working and going to school; obtaining a degree in hotel management; earning a scholarship for a hotel management program in Germany – having a successful career in hotel management---she was a woman who despite achieving success, never ever forgot where she came from. This woman, my mother, was Lynne Mitchell and I am inspired to give because of her legacy of love.\n\nAt the age of 62, my mom was diagnosed with Familial Amyloidosis.  For 2 years prior she was in and out of the hospital on a regular basis, often with life threatening symptoms and the doctors had no answers for us.  I remember the day the doctors finally diagnosed her condition.  I remember how relieved I was to finally have a name for what was wrong.  Until they explained what it was.  You see, Familial Amyloidosis is a rare genetic condition that she was born with.  Her entire life her liver produced abnormal proteins called amyloids - that for 6 decades deposited in every organ, muscle and tissue of her body. At age 60 she began to experience heart failure and a host of other serious medical problems.  Up until age 60, she was a healthy, vibrant woman.  I called her the energizer bunny because she could never sit still.  She was always doing something.  \n\nI remember after her diagnosis, doctor after doctor told me, 'Take your mom home and get her affairs in order, there is nothing we can do.'  I stood on a mountain of no’s before I got one yes.  And that yes came from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN.  The Mayo Clinic said, 'Bring your mom here, we will evaluate her.'  The typical treatment for patients with familial amyloidosis is a liver transplant -  because the liver is the factory where the bad proteins are made.  But in my mom’s case, the amyloids had practically destroyed her heart so her treatment was a HEART AND A Liver transplant. \n\nThere’s so many different things I learned from my mom’s illness, so many highs and lows – so many life and death situations.  One thing I learned was the power of hope because to keep my mom going when things were getting extremely difficult; to keep her going in order for her to continue to fight when her body was becoming so frail, I found that the most important thing was giving her an ounce of hope.  Similarly, the most important thing for the family was to have an ounce of hope.  Somebody once said that “Hope in the future gives you power in the present.” It was so important for us just to have hope in the possibility that the transplants could go through for my mom, and that the Mayo Clinic was going to be able to do better than all the different hospitals that were able to do absolutely nothing. \n\nMy mom used to always tell me, “Don’t just say you love, show your love.”  When she was in Rochester, MN waiting for her heart and liver transplants she had medication being pumped into her heart 24/7 to keep it beating.  She had a little battery-operated machine strapped to her at all times.  We had to put new batteries in every single day because we could never take a chance that the batteries stopped working.  She could barely walk.  But she was still trying to find a way to show love.  And during this time my mom adopts not one, not two, but three kids in Jamaica.  She had started the process before she became ill and after she was diagnosed, she refused to give up on her dream to give these kids the hope of a better future.  And I won’t forget this.  There was a point where my mom had to fill out some paperwork and she had to send the paperwork back to the government in Jamaica for the kids she was adopting.  And the post office was a 5-minute walk from her apartment.  But because of the fact that she is frail and she needs a new heart, she can’t do anything excessive.  And for her – a 5-minute walk was excessive– but my mom decided she had to get this paperwork off – because you can’t just say you love – you have to show you love.  It took my mom over 30 minutes to do a 5-minute walk because she had to - walk and stop; walk and stop; walk and stop - just to put those papers in the mail.  And it’s when I look back at those types of stories that I get what my mom always meant when she said, “don’t just say you love. “\n\nAfter waiting nine months, which took an even further toll on her body as her health continued to deteriorate, my mom with her weakened body walked into Mayo Clinic’s St. Mary’s Hospital after she received the long awaited call that a matching donor had been found for her. She received her transplanted organs but post transplant, she suffered and endured many major and life-threatening setbacks and spent nine months in the hospital: five of them in the Intensive Care Unit and at least two of those months on life-support.  On June 20, 2012 (her 65th birthday), my mom was able to leave St. Mary’s hospital and board a plane (albeit wheelchair-bound) and we returned home to South Florida. When we arrived at Miami International Airport, as I embraced her, she whispered to me with tears in her eyes, “I love you, thank you for everything.” She was grateful for the opportunity to be back home and more importantly to reunite with family and friends. She never however got the opportunity to enjoy her life. Still physically debilitated, wheelchair bound, dialysis dependent and unable to walk or take care of herself, my mom concealed her tears, but continued to share her smiles. She fought the good fight up to the end, never complaining and never wanting to be a burden. In September 2012, due to a massive infection, she died.  \n\nMy mom, this person who had me be who I am, I have lost her, however, what I haven’t lost is the kind of heart that she had.  And what I have come to realize is that it’s not about what life takes away from me, it’s about what I do with what’s left.   \n\nNow, as I think about how beautiful and amazing my personal journey has been and what I have been able to accomplish:\n\n-  Having had the privilege of going to the University of Chicago and Northwestern    University Law School;\n\n-  Marrying the love of my life and raising two wonderful boys together;\n\n- Working for major law firms and companies such as AutoNation and Burger King;\n\n-     Becoming the General Counsel for Bacardi North America;\n\n- Traveling all across the world; \n\n- Being in meetings with highly influential people; \n\n- Becoming a person of influence myself and being able to do so many different things. \n  \nI was 3 years old when my parents left Jamaica and 8 years old when they returned. And for those 5 years that my parents were away, I lived in the same rural community my mom grew up in in the same conditions - with no electricity and no indoor plumbing and an outhouse for a bathroom.  We drew water from a tank. Cooked outside on coals. I walked miles to school and  I went to a one-room schoolhouse just like Seaview.  So I am 100% clear that there is barely any kind of distinction between me and the kids that are back in that same rural area in Jamaica today; the one thing that I got that they don’t have is opportunity.  The one thing that kept my family going was the fact that we had hope.  And so when I lost my mom, I decided to create a non-profit charitable foundation called the Lynne Mitchell Foundation and this foundation honors my mom's legacy of love.  I started the foundation three months after she died.  Our Mission: Loving Children . . . Changing Lives.  We are hard at work in the same rural community in Jamaica where my family is from giving hope and opening doors of opportunity for children by offering high school scholarships, school breakfast, lunch, transportation, and building programs, back packs, and school supplies.  \n\nWhat I am doing through the Lynne Mitchell Foundation is creating opportunity and sewing seeds of hope.  Because back in that same rural area in Jamaica there is another Marlene, there’s another Lynne, and the only difference is opportunity and hope.  And going back to what somebody once told me: that hope in the future gives you power in the present – I know that in order to empower these kids right now, I have to help them to see some hope for the future.  And so how do I do that, I do that through education.  I do that by actually giving them opportunity.  And so I want to do something massive, something big here, but one thing I know is that I can’t do this by myself.  The Foundation is looking to continue our work in this rural area in Jamaica and give these kids the kind of education that can allow them to change the legacy of their last name; to give them the kind of education that’s going to allow them to provide for their families; to give them the kind of education that’s going to allow them to completely change the landscape of their life.  And it starts off with one thought, one foundation; one gift at a time.\n \n\n\n\n",,

I was a resident of the Sandtown-Windchester neighborhood in Baltimore, the epicenter of this April’s unrest in Baltimore City. All my life, despite struggles and setbacks, I have tried my best to support my family. In May, 2012, however, I was laid off from a good full time job. Soon, I found myself facing eviction.  Those were the dark days. No one really knew what I was going through. Moving into a shelter with my 18 year-old daughter was painful, but I told her, “Halima, we have to hold each other close.” We provided strength for one another throughout the time I was unemployed and living in a shelter. \n\nIn December 2013, while I was living in the shelter and on my way to a social service provider, I stopped into Maryland New Directions, a 42-year-old career counseling and employment assistance organization in Baltimore.  I saw the signs offering career advice, job search skills and interview skills.  Those words resonated with me; they meant I could get back on my feet. As I walked the halls of the organization, I saw the success stories of program graduates on the wall and said to myself, “I want to be one of those. I can be successful.” For the first time in a long time, I felt hopeful; I was determined something better was coming.  \n\nTo me, Maryland New Directions is not just a program, but a family.  The staff cares about me and my career future. After my graduation from the training program, which was provided completely free of charge to me and my classmates, I got two good full-time jobs.  The training at Maryland New Directions built my confidence, enabled me to stay focused, and have a structured way to strategize my own career search and then advance my career.  \n\nI didn’t know it could be this good, having money left over after my bills.  So, as soon as my daughter and I were settled in our new apartment, I made a donation to Maryland New Directions.  I now donate on a monthly basis.  I have to make sure other people can get help and be a part of an amazing organization.  I know what it’s like to need help, and I like helping people. \n\nIn addition to becoming a monthly donor, I am the first President of Maryland New Directions’ newly developed Client Advisory Board.

The case manager played with the woman’s children, sang songs with these probably 4 and 2 year old kids; braided the little girl’s hair, and wiped juice off her younger brother’s face.

I was inspired by their program to get involved in the community and was hired a year later as a Residential Technician in the same women's program that saved my life.

It's extremely important that I do my part by helping to create an atmosphere of recovery and positive change in my work environment for our clients, as well as the community we serve.

Setting a positive example, and helping people achieve their full potential by offering compassion, resources, and opportunities brings light and purpose to my own life. There is nothing more meaningful than giving, in whatever form that may be. I routinely share my personal recovery story whenever asked, because I believe that I can only keep what I have when I give it away.

I found that passion about a year ago. It all started on a regular workday when I passed Union Station's Great Hall in downtown Chicago, catching my normal Metra train home during rush hour. I recall it was the only time I would not mind if there were mass train delays. Because on that early cool December evening, chamber music filled the Great Hall with familiar holiday tunes. It lifted my spirit and mesmerized the great many commuters that were either passing by or awaiting for their scheduled trains. I've passed that hall on a regular basis over some ten years and I've never seen this type of delightful public performances. What amazed me was the young musicians (middle/high school aged kids) that performed that day. Above the stage there was a banner that read 'Merit School of Music'. That name stuck with me since then. Months later, I decided to google it. To my amazement this school (www.meritmusic.org) has been providing free or low cost music education (with free/affordable instrument rental) for children (pre-K to pre-college) in Chicago area for nearly 4 decades. Their mission has been to inspire youth to achieve their fullest potential in life through music, focusing on underserved communities. In the following summer, I signed my 4th-grade daughter up for Merit School of Music's summer String Camp. It was truly an enriching experience, for both my daughter and I. The fun-filled summer camp allowed her to not only improve her music playing, but also to build friendship with fellow campers from various parts of the city/metro areas.  As for me, I was deeply impressed with the integrity, talent, and dedication of Merit's staff and faculty.

Most importantly I value the opportunities this school has provided to area children whose families may not otherwise have the financial means to seek quality music education.

The night was calm and very warm. I was enjoying the visit of a close friend from Buenos Aires. I was sleeping very comfortable in my bed when suddenly I woke up with a very lousy noise followed by a strong movement. I got up from the bed and tried to walk towards the door but realized that I couldn't move forward. Everything was moving. My friend and I managed to reach the apartment's door and got to the building's emergency stairway. I remember going down the stairs and pieces of wall falling down in front of me. I had to make a huge effort to avoid them and not hurt myself.\nFinally, after what it seemed an eternity, we got to the building entrance down the stairs and manage to get out of the building safe and sound. \nDown there, we met with the rest of the neighbors that were escaping from the building as we did. It was then when we realized that we had experienced what it seemed one of the worst earthquake that hit Chile in its history. \nSantiago de Chile is a very modern city, probably the most modern in Latin America, where buildings are prepared to face these type of events. Therefore, what I saw in the following days were only some cracks in buildings but nothing so bad. Especially in my neighborhood, which is a high-income neighborhood in Santiago. \nHowever, it took me a few hours before I realized that outside Santiago, many extreme poor communities had been extremely affected by the earthquake. Many families had lost the few things they had and some had even lost a relative during the catastrophe. \nThe following Monday, I was at work when a colleague approached me and told me that he was volunteering for TECHO, a non-profit organization that transforms slums into sustainable communities, and whose housing program was perfect for emergencies such as the one Chile was facing at that time. \nTECHO was fundraising and massively mobilizing young volunteers in those days to build transitional houses in two days for families that had lost everything during the earthquake. I didn't doubt it for a second, and so the following weekend I was traveling with a group of colleagues to an extreme poor community four hours away from Santiago.\nWe arrived to the community Friday night; we had to sleep in sleeping bags at the local school. We woke up very early in the morning and went to meet our family, who will spend the following days building the transitional house together with us.\nA couple in their early 70s and their son who was in his 30s comprised the family. The old couple had lost their small house made out of mud and had been living in a neighbor’s car for the last week.\nIt took us two full days to build the transitional house. During those days, we shared our stories with them, and they told us about what happened, and how they ended up with nothing. We realized they had worked really hard their whole life to achieve very little and they lost that little in one night. They had nothing. Not even a home to survive the winter. We created a deep bond with them, we experienced first-hand their reality, and we were able to change it together with them.\nWhen we finished, we had a “house warming” and Luis, the head of the family, thanked us with tears in his eyes, saying that now he would be able to sleep at night knowing his family had a safe house to sleep in and get through the winter. \nThe house we had built was a transitional house, meaning it was very basic, but even so it meant everything to them.\nI went back home that day with tear in my eyes, I couldn't stop crying. \nThe earth had to move so that we all could see this reality. The earth moved so that we all could move and change this reality.

My son, Michael, had always been a healthy, energetic little boy who loved sports and learning.  On August 25, 2014, he boarded the bus for his first day of kindergarten, and he turned six years old just two days later.  Life was really good, and with Michael's little sister Lila (then 2.5 years old), our family felt happy and complete.  Suddenly, at the end of that week, Michael began complaining of double vision.  We would learn on September 4, 2014, that he had an inoperable pediatric brain tumor called DIPG (diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma), with a median survival of nine months from diagnosis and essentially a zero percent survival.  With hopes that he would be the miracle, he underwent 30 radiation treatments, followed by chemotherapy, but unfortunately Michael continued to deteriorate.  On August 24, Michael had been jumping across trampolines with his friends for his birthday party, and just weeks later, he had lost the ability to walk on his own and relied on a wheelchair.  Over a period of months, his body weight doubled due to the steroids necessary to reduce the inflammation his brain.  He lost the functioning of the left side of his body, and over time he would also be unable to speak, chew, swallow, and then finally breathe.  Michael passed away just 8.5 months later on May 17, 2015.  \n\nHis story is tragic, but also unfortunately representative of what kids facing DIPG have to confront.  The way that my son approached his illness, however, was anything but ordinary.  While his body failed him bit-by-bit every single day, his mind remained intact, and he fought with every ounce of his being.  Michael continued to go to school whenever possible, and he met each day with determination.  Michael became known for his checklists.  Each morning, he sat down with his father and wrote a list of everything he would accomplish that day, and despite his exhaustion from the treatments he endured, he would not go to sleep unless the list was completed.  He inspired thousands across the world -- from more than 60 countries -- to donate money for pediatric brain cancer research, resulting in him earning the award as the top fundraiser in one of the largest brain cancer events in the country.  Michael is without a doubt the strongest person I have known.  \n\nI give to Michael Mosier Defeat DIPG Foundation, www.defeatdipg.org, not just to honor my son -- though of course that is a part of it -- but to carry on the fight that he began.  I give because hundreds of children each year are diagnosed with DIPG, and they deserve HOPE.  They deserve people fighting for them, and that is now what I do every day.  Our family has given and will always give financially, and I have also resigned from my job as a lawyer to dedicate myself full time to this cause.  We will fight to find a cure to DIPG because we want the next family sitting in a waiting room with their normally healthy child -- who finds out they have DIPG -- to have options to save their child's life.  We will complete the final item on Michael's checklist:  Defeat DIPG.",,

In Haiti, only those who can afford the $35/month tuition can attend a school of some quality, one without 40-50 children in a classroom. Offering more children a chance to learn is what will bring Haiti to a place of self-sufficiency and develop the country in moral, social and economic ways.\n\nI was introduced to Mona Foundation, an educational world-wide NGO, just after it became a viable organization in 1999. I began volunteering as office help because I had time in the evenings, believed in its mission, and knew the organization needed assistance. As a classroom teacher myself, I strongly believe that everyone has the right to learning, especially those in developing countries. I enjoyed the work and felt I was participating towards positive change.\n \nI first visited Anis Zunuzi School in Haiti on a site visit several years before the 2010 earthquake. After the crowded, noisy, dirty and almost frantic streets of Port-au-Prince, I found the school to be an island of calm, on seven acres of shaded acreage. The staff was welcoming and capable, meeting with us on several occasions to share their vision and hopes for the future. At that time, flush toilets and showers were a priority, neither of which they had. Also, they were seeking more classroom space as the school was growing and more students wanted to enroll. Over time, Mona Foundation supporters generously funded these requests. After the massive earthquake in 2010 that devastated the country, I volunteered my services with an emergency medical team. The requested showers and toilets had just been constructed a month before! School was closed so we camped on the soccer field along with some of the staff while we held clinics in classrooms during the day. Those showers and toilets were the only ones working for miles around and were most welcome by us visitors! Many of the school staff served as volunteers to help their injured community during this time, and together with the doctors and others on the medical team, we attended about 450 people a day who came with various injuries. Members of this team returned to Haiti several times over the next few months until the need for emergency medical help had been reduced.\n\nWhen medical attention was no longer needed and the school reopened, I asked what else I could do to further assist. Their answer was “an art program,” since there was no art training available. So I came home and wrote an art curriculum for kindergarten through fourth grade, and incorporated as much of the vibrant Haitian art mediums as possible. I returned several times after that, taking art supplies, conducting teacher training sessions, and sharing ways to incorporate art activities to support their existing curriculum. Many of the ideas were “hands-on” which they seemed to enjoy since most of the teaching/learning in Haiti is done by rote memory. Most teachers themselves did not understand what a color wheel was or had ever held a paintbrush!\n\nOver time I saw changes in the classroom atmosphere, some new ideas being tried and this is exciting. One teacher even stepped in to offer classes in making paper mache animals so they could be sold in the US for scholarship money for other students. I realize that what is common in US classrooms may not be comfortable for those in Haitian classrooms, but the need for creative expression is universal. When given a chance, students anywhere will happily choose color and art materials to express themselves and their subjects. Sustaining a program like this is a personal challenge but well worth it to see the teachers’ and students’ growth. Each year I return with consumable art supplies and offer workshops with additional art ideas to support their curriculum.\n\nI will continue to visit and support Anis Zunuzi Baha'i School as much as I can when they ask for help. I feel it’s important to wait for their direction to prioritize needs for the growth of their school. Anis Zunuzi provides a quality, loving and moral education for children living in insecure situations and true poverty. This education is their path to a brighter future than they would have otherwise and in my opinion should be made available to as many children as possible. Many of the students could not attend without scholarship help because their families truly can’t afford the $35/month.\n \nI would encourage those who can to support Anis Zunuzi Baha'i School scholarship program. I have seen such positive change in students over the years I have been visiting Haiti, and how education makes the difference between opportunity in life and becoming a victim of poor environment and life circumstance. It is a child’s right to learn and sadly not every child in Haiti can exercise that right.\n\nIn communicating recently with a young man I met during my work as a volunteer in Haiti, I asked how his siblings were doing. He said school was no longer an option, because their mom could not make enough selling in the market to send all four children to school. He was on scholarship to university but the other three had to stay home. Quickly I connected with others who had worked in Haiti with me and soon we gathered scholarship support for these three children for the year, including books, uniforms and exam fees. But what of others? Many children in Haiti need financial support for their education. Thirty-five dollars a month will make a world of difference to those who have few options for school.\n",,

For months, I experienced strange aversions to smells, and had bizarre out of body sensations. My gut was screaming at me 'you have a brain tumor'. Unfortunately, an MRI would ultimately prove my suspicions were right. I was referred to Dr. William Curry, a brilliant neurosurgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital. He removed the entire tumor, and I made a full recovery. I am tumor free today, but continue to be monitored in case of a recurrence. \n\nOriginally, I kept my diagnosis, surgery, and recovery mostly private, as I could never imagine going public with my experience. But along the road to recovery, I met two friends that were also battling brain tumors. I now had an opportunity to share what I had learned, felt, and the chance to help other patients feel like they were not alone. Having that feeling that others will never understand what you're going through, and the fear that you'll never feel like yourself again is terrifying.

What was supposed to be a typical, uneventful birth turned into a fury of heart stopping moments that led me to truly appreciate those who serve others.\n\nIt started with 36 hours of labor followed by an emergency C-section, at which point they discovered that the umbilical cord had been wrapped twice around my daughter's neck, causing her to lose oxygen to her brain. Within hours of her birth, she started having seizure after seizure. She was transported to one of the best NICUs in the world as the hospital we were in wasn't equipped to deal with this situation. Over the next 24 hours she had over 100 seizures until finally doctors were able to control her with a combination of two powerful anti-seizure medications. MRI scans showed brain damage to both sides of the brain, caused by lack of oxygen. Her prognosis was unknown. Doctors said it could range from her being completely fine to severe disability to a 50% chance of her not making it past her first birthday. We were shocked to our core.\n\nThe next day, doctors called us in for more news. She had been diagnosed with an incredibly rare genetic disorder, Phenylketonuria or PKU, where a person's body cannot break down an amino acid called phenylalanine and must be on a strict low-protein diet for life.  With an occurrence rate of less than one in 15,000 births in the US, we had little information to go on.

I arrived soon after, to this beautiful dual world that spoke highly of tradition and values, and encouraged me to pursue my 'American Dream.' So I explored, I realized two confused parents and a child learning English made for barrier upon barrier for my development and overall education. Some pieces were hard, like missing the instructions for the science fair project and filling out forms like the FAFSA. But some pieces were good, like owning my identity and figuring out my passion for social work. Reflecting back, the only missing piece was someone a few steps ahead saying, 'You are are able, I'm rooting you on.' Fast forward 15 years later, and I'm working for an organization that does exactly that. Neighborhood Homework House bridges the gap between parents, schools and children. It makes things a little less scary. They take people like my parents and equip them to take leadership and feel confident in their role as a parent.

Then they take people like me, with potential and minimal opportunities and they say 'Here are academic, social, and emotional tools you need to succeed.' They root people on, WE root people on!

During the summers, I'd help my mom with housekeeping to help provide food for the family. When my dad decided to walk out on us for a few years, I helped with becoming the second mom at the age of twelve. When days were tough, I'd console my mom so she wouldn't reach for the alcohol.  This seemed normal for me because I figured it was just me going through this. I was so wrong. Within the first few weeks at NHH, my story resonated with the students I was working with. It was as if my history was repeating itself but through someone else. I see many of the students identify themselves as what they are living instead of their potential. Instead of seeing they are so much more. NHH has given me a chance to redeem my story. To look at a student and say 'quiero más para ti' and mean it. To give a single mother hope that it gets better knowing there are tools for her to move forward through workshops that are offered. To want more for a child is not taking away from a parent's role, but instead giving the parent the confidence that they need. Everyday that I walk into NHH, I am reminded that we all work in unison because we want more for families. We want them to thrive and want them to see their potential. For majority of the staff, our stories are echoed through the families being served and we are reminded of our own beginnings. We are reminded that we are in the place where we are because someone wanted more for us. And now we are able to do the same and want more for families. ",,

Dr. Monica Rudiger was working there and told them about her no kill shelter called Nine Lives Foundation. They gave Koko to her and never followed up with her again.\nI came to volunteer 8 years ago at Nine Lives when Koko was 3.5 months old.

I had a month off work so I worked with him every day to make him stronger and after three months he was playful kitten.\nAbout a year later he started to have seizures. We were told that this sometimes happens and he would have to be on meds his entire life which may not be long....But we wanted to know why he was getting these seizures that we had to keep increasing his meds. So we had an MRI done and the neurologist vet said he had never seen this before. Koko only had half a brain. The other side of his brain is filled with fluid. I called my friend Bill who is cat lover, who had my first cat Leticia two sons, Linus and Rolo who is an epileptic neuro-surgeon at UCSF.

Some of his favorites are pot roast, steak pizzola, spicy beef with broccoli, filet migon, focaccia bread, and the cake part of cupcakes. But his normal diet is high protein and high fat to reduce his seizures. He loves coconut oil but it has to be organic or he won’t eat it.

Collectively, they decided to create a campaign traveling from class to class, educating children about malaria and how to best prevent it.\n\nThe outpouring was resounding—we collected over $3,000 in change just from the students in our elementary school, in one-hour lunch periods over the course of three days. Our students experienced firsthand what it feels like to make a difference which impacted families just like their own, in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nBecause of our work, we along with nine students and their families were invited to join Nothing But Nets at their inaugural Champions Summit to participate in a symposium which culminated in a day of lobbying on Capitol Hill.

We raised over $1,000 for Nothing But Nets through this project.\n\nIn all of our various ongoing awareness raising projects, the curiosity in our student’s voices and twinkle in their eyes from fighting malaria serves as validation that our risk-taking in the classroom by way of service learning has delivered powerful results.

I first found the OAC when I was denied treatment for my obesity. I remember sitting alone in my car and crying. It didn't make sense to me that my insurance would pay for medications, treatments, specialists for several obesity-related health conditions but I was denied treatment for obesity itself. There were treatments available to help me regain my health, relieve the life threatening and debilitating illnesses I was suffering from and prevent the onset of others, how could they deny that?! It didn’t make sense. I felt alone until I found the OAC. I was thankful to know there was an organization that was working to increase access to care and treatment. I knew I had to get involved. I never want anyone to have to go through what I did.  There should be no shame in seeking treatment for obesity, health is not a game. Obesity is a disease that affect millions of adults and children, in fact, since millions are affected everyone knows someone, loves someone or may be that someone who is affected like I am. I will always be a person affected by obesity, it's a chronic disease requiring reassessing and adjusting throughout life but today I am healthier and stronger and thankful for the OAC. \n\nThe OAC provides wonderful free resources to educate the public about obesity, its causes, effects and helping people gain access to the science-based obesity treatment methods available for those that seek them. So much misinformation is out there about obesity and while people often mean well that misinformation can be harmful or worse. The OAC helps distinguish the science from the scams. The OAC also conducts advocacy efforts throughout the U.S. on both the state and national levels educating policymakers about obesity and how treating obesity can help prevent, or lessen the impact, of so many obesity-related conditions. The OAC fights to eliminate bias and stigma those affected by obesity face in world by shining a light on the insensitivity (and sadly often cruelty) those affected by obesity face in schools, workplaces, media, healthcare, society. I especially love the Your Weight Matters Convention they host each year where I’ve gained friendships, support and the comfort of knowing I will never be that girl crying alone in my car. The OAC’s mission and good works inspires me to give back as a board member and I hope they inspire you too.\n",,

In November of 2014, I knew the need was going to be great for ODM this winter, with over 100 men in their homeless shelter programs; they were running low on everything from blankets to soap. I created the Cover the City Project to support Open Door in collecting blankets for the homeless in our area. This is an all-volunteer and donation based project. With only 2 weeks to get together items and participants, we thought that we would only get around 200 blankets; little did we know God had other plans for us. For our first blanket drive the city of High Point had over 15 drop off locations, 4 private businesses donating, and 6 giveaway donors, we ended up collecting over 800 blankets last year and helped more than just Open Door. We helped four other non-profit organizations last year as well and were able to serve over 700 people who needed something to keep warm during the winter months. During my lifetime, I have been very blessed to have positive role models to show me that you should always help others and do good for those in need. Being able to give back to the community in which I have grown up in is very important to me and my family. This blanket could be just what someone needs to be comforted. I have volunteered at Open Door Ministries for several years and this project was something that I created because I knew there was a need and without the help of volunteers and donors, it may not happen. We decided last year that this would be an annual project to help Open Door and anyone else who just happened to be down on their luck. For the 2015 blanket drive we have expanded to Greensboro, Winston Salem and Asheboro, North Carolina and also to Spartanburg, South Carolina in order to reach more of the people in need. Giving back is something that I enjoy and if I could do it full time life would be amazing but God has other plans for me so I will continue to do this as long as possible, but only with the help of like-minded people and the trust that Open Door gives me to be able to do a project like this.

TRUE,14,6,8,42328.45103,174.51.185.175,84-1538872,TRUE,FALSE,80205,"Finding the Power in Poverty.\n\nWhat does one private-schooled twenty-three year old from Kentucky have in common with a room filled with thirty or so nine to thirteen year old boys and girls in a Title 1 school in Denver, Colorado? There are a few things I can name: ambition, aspiration, dreams, passion, hunger and enthusiasm. But, there is something else that I share with these students, something under the surface that others may not see, even if they were looking, and that is, we all live in poverty.\n\nMy state of poverty, however, was a conscious choice. I joined the AmeriCorps VISTA program after graduating college because I wanted a taste of the reality that so many Americans experience.  As a child, I thought my life was normal – Catholic school, new uniforms and shoes at the start of each school year, my mom’s minivan in the carpool line, my dad’s powder-blue Cadillac coming home from work each day, being coaxed to take a few more bites of my green beans so I could have ice cream for dessert – but in college, I began to realize just how much privilege I had.\n\nFor some of us reading this, myself included, college was less of an option and more of a “next step.” Throughout my high school career, I was always preparing for college: thinking about where I’d want to go, what I’d want to major in, what organizations or clubs I would want to get involved in once I got there. Family reunions were filled with questions of “How is school going?” and “Where are you thinking of going to college?” My parents supported my every whim; they took me on college visits across Kentucky, Ohio, South Carolina, Massachusetts and Florida. At the ripe age of eighteen, I felt as though the possibilities were endless; all I had to do was follow my dreams. The whole world was within my reach; all I had to do was listen to my heart so I knew what to reach for. It was only once I got to college in Lexington, Kentucky that I began to meet those my age who had fallen behind due to circumstance: those for whom college was more financial trouble than it was worth, those who had full-time jobs they needed to work in order to help their families, those who hadn’t finished high school because they were abusing drugs and alcohol and they had no one who cared enough to stop them. I began to realize I was very, very lucky.\n\nAfter graduation, I wanted to share the gifts I had been given with others, somehow. That is why I was drawn to the AmeriCorps VISTA program. VISTA members choose to live and serve in some of our nation’s poorest urban and rural communities. Members make a one-year commitment to live at the poverty line of a single person in the area they are serving. Many members, like myself, come from backgrounds where they know their friends or families can pick them up and support them should they fall. For the students I have met during my AmeriCorps service, this is often not their reality. They are usually born into poverty and often into families who have known nothing else for generations. While people like me are exploring opportunities, trying to choose from an infinite spectrum of possibilities, and using a year in poverty for personal growth – others are looking for just one door to open up, one light to appear at the end of an infinite maze of tunnels. All along I have been patting myself on the back for graduating college and beginning my professional career, but then I realized, I was congratulating myself on hitting a home run when I had started on third base.\n\nOpenWorld Learning can be that door, that light, for so many students.  It is important to understand how damaged people or people from damaged backgrounds don’t always know how to say “yes” or to choose the big thing. It’s a shame that they carry – the shame of not believing they deserve to stand in the same way, in the same room, with people who may have started ahead of them. It is difficult to think “yes” or to think “up,” when all you know is fight or flight, when all you know is eat or get eaten up. We all trigger things inside other people, whether it be lighting a fire or causing a storm. OpenWorld Learning seeks to show all children that their minds, their imaginations, their stories that they have to tell are just as beautiful and radiant as their peers who may have started out with more. OpenWorld Learning believes that any student is capable of becoming a leader, of learning complex concepts of math, science, technology and engineering and of developing a love of learning that will be their ticket to places they couldn’t imagine before. OpenWorld Learning is here to tell these children that they have every right to sit at the same table.",,

Due to the distance, I would pack snacks and drinks just in case.\n\nIn 2014, I wanted to give my boys something special for their Marine Corps birthday present.

I began spreading the word on Facebook, letting people know that I offer FREE rides to our service members, and I would be available for giving rides throughout the holiday season.\n\nAfter an overwhelming need, and so many requests, I realized the need for an organization like Operation: Destination Homebound. I didn’t want to exclude any service members because their needs may be different, and I also realized the need was not just on holidays but throughout the year.\n\nRecently, I was fortunate enough to have a transitioning Marine stay with us.  It was then that I realized that not just active duty folks deserved a ‘Thank You’ or assistance. Veterans often go without notice or assistance after separating from the service. Some don’t have transportation or the money to get to the VA Hospital or the Veterans Administration.\n\nFor these reasons and many others, Operation: Destination Homebound was created. We are not just a ride and a snack/water, we are a ear to listen and a caring heart.  We offer rides to all service members, active or veteran status, as well as their families.\n\nOperation: Destination Homebound will never accept money for these rides.

Sometimes, we give in ways we would never have imagined. For me, it was through running, an activity I discovered late in my life but has given me rewards beyond the obvious physical improvements. Last winter, via the power of social media, I happened to see a story on people making a difference in my state. And within that list, I learned about a non-profit group called OutRUN 38, which seeks to support those living with Cystic Fibrosis, support research for a cure, as well as promote healthy living for all. Cystic Fibrosis is a life-threatening genetic disease which affects the lungs and digestive system of more than 70,000 people around the world, and essentially robs them of the ability to breathe freely. This charity was meaningful to me because it involved running, about which I am passionate, and Cystic Fibrosis, of which I am a genetic carrier.\n\nBecause of OutRUN 38, I am giving practically daily to a cause in which I truly believe. Whenever I run, I log my miles for the charity; I post about my running adventures on social media for the charity, creating awareness for the organization; and when I can, financially, via purchasing merchandise or signing up for an OutRUN activity. OutRUN 38 has given me a way to help that is far more than just writing a check. But OutRUN 38 has given back to me as well, as the charity’s “Outrun the Odds” Facebook community, which features thousands of members around the world, is a support page for everyone who is a part of it, a community where one receives encouraging words for any “odds” its members may face.\n\nThe Outrun 38 community is involved in races all over the country, wearing the charity’s name on shirts and creating an awareness for a cause about which we are passionate. Just weeks ago, at the Hartford Marathon, nearly 150 runners donned the 'Outrun 38' logo, pounding the pavement in three separate road races that weaved through streets past tens of thousands of spectators.\n\nAs Outrun 38 'outrunners,' we run for those who can’t, especially those with a disease essentially robbing them of their breath. And as a result, our running has become much more than footsteps. It is a healing, philanthropic act. The act of running may bring mental toughness to our mind and brawniness to our bodies, but “outrunning” has made our hearts stronger and better in so many ways, allowing us give back, help others, and find a sense of community that feeds our souls. \n\nFor more information, visit www.outrun38.org\n\n",,

Outside the Bowl (www.outsidethebowl.org) allows me to donate, volunteer and actually see the difference they are making in Mexico, Haiti and South Africa.\n\nAfter learning through my church how Outside the Bowl builds kitchens to supply hearty soup to local organizations—including orphanages, senior centers, schools, and hospitals—in areas where there is no food security, I decided to support them with a small, monthly donation. Then, this summer, I had the opportunity to go to Haiti to assist them in establishing a new, larger kitchen in Port-au-Prince. I knew I had to do something more than just write a check every month.\n\nI learned that Outside the Bowl hires only local men and women to run and work in each of their kitchens. Every day, soups are made using traditional recipes and community-grown produce, when possible. Meals are made in large kettles, transferred into 5-gallon buckets, and driven out to groups that partner with OTB. The soup is made and dispersed throughout the day—feeding thousands of children and adults on a daily basis.\n\nOne afternoon, I helped out at an orphanage that provides soup to about 100+ children in the surrounding community. Outside the Bowl often provides the only hot meal—and sometimes the ONLY meal—that these poorest of the poor receive. Unlike here in the United States, when these children eat, there is no talking, laughing or silliness. They are serious about eating and they eat quickly. When some of the older children were finished, I watched them prey upon the food of the younger children—taking whatever was left and hurriedly eating it. It broke my heart to see these tiny children trying to protect what little food they had. I realized that this is what hunger does. It turns playmates into predators and leaves the most vulnerable at risk. Thankfully, I was able to rescue the plate of a little girl and feed her the rest of her meal.\n\nWhile in Haiti, I realized that giving to Outside the Bowl is actually like supporting multiple not-for-profit organizations. Once a kitchen is established, OTB works with and partners with local ministries and social service organizations that are responsible for feeding large groups of people. OTB provides meals that are less expensive, more nutritious and better tasting than most can get through other food services or on-site kitchens. These groups are able to save on feeding costs, allowing more money to stay in their own coffers to help more people. \n\nThrough these partnerships, OTB kitchens become self-sustaining. The small amount paid to OTB for meals goes toward staff wages, soup ingredients, and overhead. Any extra, beyond expenses, is divided with half going into a fund for repairs or kitchen emergencies and the other half into a fund to build new kitchens in other communities.\n\nThrough this experience, I discovered that the money I give not only helps to build one kitchen, but provides jobs for local employees and farmers and ultimately helps to fund other kitchens into perpetuity. I talked with OTB partners and saw how other ministries and organizations receive the benefit of good, nutritious food at a cost savings that allows them to help more people and provide more services. But most importantly, I saw how my support provides life sustaining food—something that I so often take for granted—to truly hungry children. \n",,

I had been through a difficult period in my life with a lot of changes – job changes, deteriorated health, and my twin sister moving abroad – and I knew I needed to get healthy and balanced again. I had been commuting to another job for a year, and now that I would be starting a new job close to home in Pasadena, I wanted to find a community and something to ground me in a world of change. \n\nWhat makes the Pasadena Pacers unique in my mind is the sense of community and fun. When I first came to the Pacers, I felt so incredibly welcome and first joined the pre-conditioners, then half marathoners. We genuinely come to enjoy running at 7 am on a Saturday, and we love the people around us in the sea of red Pacer jerseys. I see another thing in common that motivates us – we want something better for ourselves and to be part of something bigger than ourselves. Early on, a friend told me her philosophy that it is good to run with both someone who brings you up and someone you can bring up. In the various Pacer groups I’ve run with, I always find this to be the case. I find so much inspiration in my peers, and it’s so rewarding when I am able to inspire others to improve or challenge themselves.\n\nAfter running my first two half marathons in 2014 with the support of numerous friends, I woke up one January morning knowing I needed a new challenge. Our coach Edgar had been encouraging me to join the 20 mile challenge group for quite some time and I was finally ready. Even though I was at the back most of the time the first few weeks, I was happy there and knew I’d eventually work my way up. I wanted to share my excitement with others, so I introduced several of my close friends – Ren, Keelia and Liz – to join the Pacers and have seen them grow so much.\n\nI began training with everyone for the Los Angeles Marathon, even though I would be abroad in Chile for my sister’s wedding during the race. Each weekend long run, we were accomplishing new distances I’d never run before. Usually the last mile or so was really hard, but going the distance and still feeling alive afterward gave me the confidence that I could do a marathon.\n\nAt my sister’s wedding in Chile, I met an amazing man, Martin, and I fell in love! He loved my passion for running and started running, too. We would follow each other’s runs through RunKeeper while abroad, and he trained for his first 10K with his brother in Argentina and a few weeks later I ran my first marathon at Mountains to Beach! (Big thanks to my friend who transferred me her race bib for this coveted race!)\n\nMy running friends were some of the first to know when I decided to move to Argentina with Martin. They’ve supported me whole-heartedly and have plotted so many thoughtful going-away parties and presents. I cannot tell you how thankful and blessed I feel to be part of the Pacer family. I wish I could take them with me! This has by far been one of the hardest communities of friends to leave, but I am so looking forward to this next phase of my life, love, and career living in a beautiful new country. And as I move to Mendoza later this month, I will take running with me. This will be my constant amidst a world of change again. \n\nI wish it were easy to find a free running group that is as much fun as this one anywhere you go in the world. It’s not as common as you’d think. So I’m personally very invested our initiative to share the Pacer model with other groups who want to establish free running groups in their community. I am so grateful for the difference Pacers has made in my life and I want others to have this opportunity as well. So I will continue to support with my time, philanthropy, and love.

At the end, he could not hide his excitement about how the running community is so positive and he mentioned how he admires the goodwill of the Pacers. “They are always willing to help and support other runners, they do not mind what they have to sacrifice and do not even care if the runners belong to the Pasadena Pacers or not”. Listening to those words coming from an outsider was really meaningful and reassuring that I am at the right place, with the right people and at the right moment.\n\nOf course, he could not forget to remind me of the time when he used to call me a “Pacer Wannabe”.  That was the time when I wanted so badly to go run with them, but I just stayed home saying I wanted to go.  I was actually afraid of joining the Pacers. I had been running solo for 3 years and had read about all the benefits of running with people (conversational pace? Is that possible? Runners are nuts! They talk and run!!!) And I already knew Pasadena Pacers was the team I wanted to join, I mean, come on! It’s free!\n\nBut I was afraid. Why? Because I did not want to be judged for my speed, my form or the “few miles” I could run at that time.  Also, because I was an immigrant and I was worried of being discriminated or that someone could make fun of my Sofia Vergara accent :P. I was afraid that people would not understand me or that I would never make friends.\n\nI could not be more wrong.\n\nOne day, I decided to start my journey with the Pacers volunteering for the Cheer Station at the LAM 2014 and to see what could come from there.  I went and introduced myself to Dr. Smith, I told him my story and he said I was a “Pacer at Heart” (a better way to say that Wannabe thing). I have never felt so welcome in my life. I just mingled with everyone as if I already was one of them. They did not mind my accent or the fact that I had never run with them.  \n\nThe next Saturday morning I went to the Rose Bowl, saw the sea of red and felt extremely lost and scared. It must have been pretty obvious, because everyone wanted to help me. In a matter of minutes, I had found the group they thought was perfect for me. It was! That day I ran as far as I could: South Route, all the way to… Señor Fish and back. 5 miles. I came back to the tables and the other runners gave me high-fives and words of encouragement. I was thirsty and hungry as hell and I was able to drink and eat what I needed right away, without having to wait until I drove home. I was walking on clouds!\n\nThat day, on that very first run with the Pasadena Pacers, I stopped feeling alone because I saw people that loved running as much as I did. I stopped being afraid of being judged or discriminated, because the Pacers were kind, respectful and loving people: they made me feel that I belonged. I felt inspired by a lot of runners I saw that day and that encouraged me to start my running blog months later.\n\nMy heart was full of love, eagerness, and dreams of new distances, races and speeds. It was one of the best days of my life and I am forever thankful for that. When I got home, I registered to bring water and post run refreshments for like a month. I just wanted to give back. I wanted the new runners to feel as welcome as I felt; to feel the happiness and goodwill I felt that day. I wanted to be part of this amazing community and I could not think of a better way to do it than bringing bananas, Hawaiian Bread and orange juice.\n\nI still do it and when I cannot, I make sure to donate some bucks to the Green Can. Why? Because that is my way to say thank you to every single runner that makes this group, the best running club in Southern California. If I mention every detail of how I came to know the Pacers or the journey and the incredible people I have met, this will be way longer than it already is.

After about a year with the group, John Beatty asked me and Charlene to take over the weekly Saturday volunteer organizing (aka The Water Mafia).\n\nBeing a Pacer means staying fit and healthy, eating like a horse, giving to people, helping people reach their goals, getting to see the same joy/excitement in them that I felt after running my first marathon. 'Being a part of', Getting pumped up, and pumping others up! It has got me looking forward to my Saturday mornings...especially the cold ones! I love running in the cold!\n\nNow I take my running shoes every time I go on vacation. I never used to do that.\n\nThe main reasons that I give back and that I will always give back to the Pacers are:\nOn my very first run with the Pacers, I fell behind, the hills were tough. I believe it was John Beatty that came back out to check on me and make sure that I was okay. He had heard from the others that I was new and that I was still out there. I'll never forget that and I often share that with others. It makes me feel good to help the group out and to hear them say 'thank you'. Our group breeds givers and selfless people. There are many people that help out time and time again. And of course, our Mile 20 cheer tent in the L.A. Marathon is the best in the world. Not exaggerating!! \n\nI love the Pacers. I am very blessed to be a part of this group. The group has changed my life for the better and I know that my life will continue to get better the longer that I stay in the group!!\n",,

You mean my son Omar can paint pretty pictures?” It wasn’t until the psychologist repeated the word several times until I realized what he meant. Autistic. Autism. Scary words. So I did what any parent would do. I researched... and what I discovered wasn’t very inspiring.\n\nSome places I researched mentioned my boy would never speak, that he would never feel emotion, that he would never ever be independent. The emotional strain as unbearable…and the financial strain of various treatments and therapies began to challenge my family as well. It was a shock I could never have anticipated. I looked to my spouse for comfort, but discovered he was just as lost. So I had no one to talk to, no family or friends, with whom I could share the burden I was feeling.\n\nShortly afterward, Omar’s twin brother, Georgie was also diagnosed with autism. I had been in denial for the longest time because I didn’t want to think it could happen. Why us? Why our family? My marriage began to crumble because of our lack of communication and our inability to manage the trials we were going through.\nSo I grieved. I grieved the life I IMAGINED my kids would have had. I grieved my marriage and the life I had I IMAGINED for myself. The darkness was all-encompassing, and the weirdest thing is that it seemed worse the more I tried to shake it. “Be strong…” “You have to be there for your kids,” people meant well with their advice, but when the storm of depression is raging inside you, no one really understands.\n\nOne evening I met a young lady who told me about her running group, the Pasadena Pacers. “Come run with us, you’ll have fun.” I had never imagined doing such a thing, I wasn’t a “Runner,” but I joined them anyway on their yearly “Homegirl Café” run in 2013.\nThe first thing I noticed is how EVERY single person was smiling…and not just nice-to-meet you formal smiles, REALLY BIG we’re-glad-you’re-here smiles. I felt at ease but very insecure…I didn’t know if I would return. Eventually, I came back. The people I met that day were the reason I returned.\n\nSlowly, (very slowly) I started filling my days with a run here, a run there. And a haze began to lift. My depression became manageable, I dropped some weight (30 lbs.), and I found this willingness to fight. Yes, my life and my children’s lives did NOT fit that perfect “mold” that I imagined, but whose life does? With every mile conquered, I began to realize that I was a fighter. I was going to fight to make sure my children would have the best possible opportunities they could in this life. It was on me. I could do this!\n\nTwo years later, I am in such a good place. I am thankful for my kids’ progress, I have a great relationship with my ex-husband, (we are awesome co-parents) and I honestly tell you… Running saved my life, and running with the Pasadena Pacers enriched the quality of my life and made me a better parent. It made me normal.\n\nNothing is perfect. Yes, I still have bad days and loads of stress on my back from the ugly woes that Autism throws my way. But I look forward to my Saturdays with the Pacers so much…because when I run, I am free. All the loads of negativity and stress and depression melt away. And I am me again. I am alive. HOPE is alive. I AM a runner. Thank you Pacers!\n\nwww.pasadenapacers.org",,

Children run around playing hide and seek until dusk. One may hear in the neighborhood, parents screaming their childrens’ names to come inside because it’s getting dark. \nI was told that my parents divorced when I was only two months old. My father was abusive and my mother ran away. I rarely saw my mother while I was growing up. Out of my mother’s fear of returning, her sister, my Tita Elle, would visit me during that time. \n \nMy father was a drunk and an abusive person.  He would beat my eldest sister with a two by four plank or a belt, or anything he could get his hands on whenever he got home and thought his house was not cleaned.  My sister ran away and came to the United States of America with my mother, my older sister Leoren, a stepfather, and two half younger sisters. \n\nLife comes with hardships and memories.  After my sister had left, I inherited the abuse she was getting from my father.  One night, my father came home drunk as always and told me to sit on his lap. I obeyed like a good son who only yearned for his father’s love. He asked if I cleaned his house and I responded with a yes.  As we talked more, his hand landed between my legs.  I wiggled to get free and stood up, stared him down and in my head, I punched him.  I felt betrayed. I took off running towards the front of the house and towards the gate.  My only thought was to escape the hell I was going through in that moment.  I took off running, darting to exit to the gate as my Tita and Tito stood crying for me. \n\nI ran for a very long time. I kept on running until I was a city away from San Jose City.  I kept on looking back, with the thought that he was chasing after me.  Every time I saw his image behind me, or so I thought, I would keep running.  I kept running until the thought of not having a home, a bed to sleep, or food to eat dawned on me. I ran until I could not run anymore.  I was a ten-year-old boy in a dark street with tears flowing down my cheeks at three in the morning. I turned around and went back home.  By the time I got home, I was expecting my father and Tito to be out and gone looking for me.  It was my Tito Teody that was gone. My Tita Consuelo hugged me tight, while my father was passed out asleep and snoring.\n\nI learned not how to run, but I learned what I was capable of enduring as a person.  My mother later took me to California, where I was reunited with my sisters. I began a fresh start as a kid.  With my newfound talent, I joined the middle school track & field after the P.E. teacher witnessed me run the mile P.E. exam with the time of six minutes and thirty-six seconds.  In high school, I excelled in track & field and cross-country.  I took my talent with me as I joined the United Stated Marine Corps in 2007 as an infantry and was honorably discharged in 2011.  \n\nAfter taking a two-year break from running, I discovered the Pasadena Pacers through my friend Lara.  The Pasadena Pacers is a group full of runners with positive vibes and they are all oozing with motivation.  It was time that I made a come back.  Although it was a slow come back having not run for two years, I started coming out joining the group every Saturday morning.  Two months after my first run with the Pacers, I decided it was time to officially claim a slice of ownership by purchasing a Pacers singlet.  Since my time running with the Pacers, I gained my confidence and speed back.  The Pacers gave me reasons to run: focus on what is important in life, goals to achieve, and challenges to overcome.\n\nI found a list of The Top Ten Marathons, dedicating each to someone in my family, a brother in arms, or someone that made an impact on making me the person I am today.  Five months after joining the Pacers, I ran my first marathon, the Los Angeles Marathon, with the time of five hours and thirty minutes. Seven months after that, I ran Portland Marathon with the time of three hours and fifty-one minutes. I am thankful for having been introduced to the Pasadena Pacers and am glad I am now able to give back to the group by being one of the Pasadena Pacers Los Angeles Marathon 2016 training coaches.  \n\nI run for those who cannot fight.  I run for my mother and those who suffers from being in an abusive relationship.  I run for my brothers in arms I had the pleasure of serving with who did not make it back home. They are the reason that I can run and enjoy life freely.  I run for my Tita Elle who died of an aneurism.  It was her looks and similar features to my mother that gave me comfort as a child.  It was her hugs and kisses that came closest to my mother’s.  I run for my Tito Teody who died of a heart complication and did not have a fighting chance.  It was him who taught me how to cook. He set an example for me to see that we all have options in this world and we can choose what we want to do in life. I run for my brother in law who died in a car accident due to poor weather condition when he was heading to work.  It was him who showed me how to have fun.  It was he and my eldest sister Krystina that would get me out of the house and show me how to have a great time in my pre-teenage years when I first came to the United States.  I run for my sister Leoren who is suffering from multiple sclerosis.  She taught me how to be strong and how to be stubborn and to keep on fighting even when hope seems to fade away.  I run… for my Tita Consuelo who never smoked or drank alcohol and is now suffering from a stage-four lung cancer.  It was her who taught me patience and to always do the right thing. To always treat others how I would want to be treated.  \n\nI run to inspire others…that no matter what or how big the obstacle is in your life right now, all you need is a pair of running shoes, a great group of people to run with and everything will be okay.   \n\nLearn how to join and support the Pasadena Pacers at www.pasadenapacers.org ",,

Even though it is my part of my career to assist in providing dental care in an office setting, I always felt the need to do more where the need is greater. Thanks to the Pacific Dental Services Foundation, my passion to serve bloomed even more when I was chosen as a volunteer to join them in their week long trip of service to Ethiopia. The amount of donated dentistry that was donated within that week was phenomenal! We changed the lives of so many men, women, and children and even to this day I can remember clearly the big smiles they had after being cared for. It has been a little bit over a year since I had the opportunity to serve in Ethiopia with the PDS Foundation, and I'm proud to say that I am now working as the Coordinator of this amazing non-profit organization. At the moment, I coordinate and attend most of our non-profits Mobile Dental Clinic events that take place in 11 states. In each event, the lives of so many underprivileged people are changed just by getting their dental needs cared for at no cost to them. The feeling of knowing that I have had a small part in making this world brighter one smile at a time is in a simple term: PRICELESS!

Pages & Chapters is a literacy nonprofit based in Kansas City, Missouri, with a vision of providing support, resources, and encouragement to Title 1 families in order to foster critical literacy skills in existing family units.  They do this by hosting a program called Open Books, which is family literacy workshops offered to K-5 students and their parents.  The main idea is for parents and kids to work together to practice literacy strategies in a workshop-type setting.  The Open Books curriculum is available for free download on their website for community members or teachers to implement.  \nThe last three years with this nonprofit are the most rewarding years of my life.  I have learned so much about what it takes to foster a love of reading and about how important literacy skills are to everyday life.  Because of my time with Pages & Chapters, I give to them as much as I possibly can.  The time and effort put in by all the individuals who help to write the curriculum, run the Open Books workshops, and who keep spreading the love of reading, inspires me to give back.  It costs each school that runs Open Books $400 and it is vital to keep Open Books in current schools, plus spread awareness to even more schools.  \nIt means so much to give back to this nonprofit because I can see the happiness on a child’s face after completing a session of Open Books with improvements to their literacy skills.  It is the most rewarding feeling having a child read a book that they were unable to read just a few weeks before.

I spent several years reaching out to schools, non profits and civic ​leaders to engage the Philadelphia region in this global day of local opportunity. ​Schools began observing Peace Day, including my son's school, as well as library after-school programs and several universities. ​I also reached out to people across the world who where forming ​P​eace ​Day ​initiatives in their cities​and created a forum for sharing successes and best practices to help one another​. I developed content and activity ideas for a website​ (www.peacedayphily.org)​, now referred to by key Peace Day leaders as the best​ ​​International Day of Peace resource globally. \n\nFor each of the past 3 years, dozens of programs ​have been a part of the ​annual ​week​-​long effort of P​DP, engaging 30 - 50 organizations annually in the process.​ Service to others, peace skill education/training, the arts, interfaith/intercultural dialogue and sports have been among the main types of activities that have taken place for PDP. ​(More information ​about past activities ​here:​ http://bit.ly/10FCgpE​.)​ Philadelphia's Mayor and Police Commissioner, as well as the PA ​Senate, support ​PDP's ​efforts. ​​\n\nIn late 2013, Peace Day Philly became a non​-​profit organization. I and a small group ​have ​continue​d​ to work​, as ​volunteers​. I do much of the outreach, program development, organizational management, website maintenance, social media and fundraising for PDP. We direct all donations toward our program efforts, which include our own contributions. \n\n​My work has encouraged others to take action as well, and ​our model​ has ​inspired other US cities including Dayton, OH and Austin, TX in terms of it's broad-based approach to engaging people in Peace Day. When I am invited to speak to groups, I emphasize that anyone can make a difference in their world. Look at me, a mom and social worker who ​became​ a driving force in creating a non​-​profit for peace. \n\nMy journey, though it has included many sacrifices and challenging moments, has allowed me the opportunity to​ mov​e beyond my fears and ​feelings of inadequacy to build something around a cause that impacts us all - personally, locally and globally. \n\nIf chosen​,​ I would give the individual portion of the prize back to Peace Day Philly.

You see my mother, Joan, was an animal lover and taught me to be the same! (more on this later) My father, Don, was the kindest of men and I will never forget the time my close friend was struggling as a single mom to pay her bills.  My Dad took an old worn and folded $50 bill from has wallet and told me he had been carrying it with him for years.  Years ago he knew a man that was struggling and wanted to give him the money, but didn't know how to go about it, so he carried that bill with him for over 40 years looking for the right person to give it to.  He handed me that $50 bill and told me to give it to my friend, anonymously, and to tell her to pay it forward someday when she could afford to. He was her secret Angel that day!  \n\nFlash forward to 2004, my dad had passed in 1998 and my mom passed in May of 2004.  Circumstances surrounding her passing had led me to find two feral cat mamas that had 11 newborn kittens.  I knew those kittens needed me and when they were 3 weeks old I removed them from their feral moms and began to bottle feed them.  Kittens that age are still human friendly, that's why I had to save them at that age. Well, word got out and people and local veterinarians began to call me about strays they found, asking me to take them too.  Thanks to my parents love for animals and helping others, I soon realized that it was fate and that I should start an animal rescue.  You see the vet that I took those 11 kittens to for a check up told me that they were probably born the same day (two moms, two litters) and it was the day that my Mom passed away!\n\nThat year Pet Angel Adoption & Rescue Inc. was born and is still going strong and I am proud to say that I am still a 'volunteer' at Pet Angel, as I do not get paid for running it. It has grown to include around 15 other volunteers and one part time office employee.  Pet Angel is in a rented building and licensed by the Michigan Dept. of Ag.  We adopt out cats only and around 150 a year find new loving homes through our care.  \n\nIt has been a struggle over the years for my family for me to be running a non-profit and not getting paid, as we are raising two children on a single income.  I wouldn't change a thing though, as my children now 20 and 17, have learned the importance of volunteering and giving back to the community by volunteering at the rescue and watching what I do.  I am proud to say they have both found other ways to volunteer in our community and love doing so! This is one of my parents legacies, the passing of the importance of volunteering to my Children!\n\nMy parents did not live to see Pet Angel or how it has impacted my life, my childrens lives and my communities, but it is truly their legacy, as it was what they instilled in my heart that allowed Pet Angel to become a reality!  \n\nThat is my story of my parents legacy and Pet Angel Adoption & Rescue Inc., the non-profit that I give to every day! \n\nwww.petangeladoption.com\n\n",,

These words come to my mind when I hear it:  fear, loss, grief, suffering, heartbreak, depression, STIGMA, pain without words. Because of The Peyton Riekhof Foundation for Youth Hope, these words also resonate:  Hope, treatment, overcoming, healing, community. \n\nYou see, my neighbor and friend's teenage daughter died by suicide only a few years ago. Their daughter was amazing and one of my favorite kids. She was beautiful, she was smart, she had south kindness in her heart for others, she was a great friend, she was a softball player, an amazing sister, she was my girls' babysitter.

Her family cared, got her treatment did their best for her, and still.....\n\n Her name was Peyton. Her father, being a 'doer' and working through and with his grief, quickly founded a not-for-profit in her name, with the mission of reducing suicides among her community's youth. He found community experts and resources and organized a Board. He built a website. He organized community programs, bringing a speaker to the local high schools to talk about suicide--a door once closed tight to this topic. He organized a local softball tournament, Play for Peyton, to increase awareness of resources and decrease stigma. His team in the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention Out of the Darkness Walk raised the most money year 1. He has used funds raised to start support groups within local schools. He bravely tells his story, and her story, depite that it is hard, to help others. He is involved with the mayors local task force for suicide prevention. All in just over one year. You see, Peyton is not the only teen in her community of youths to take her own life. And this has to stop. \n\nA teenager who was present at one of Peyton's fathers local talks emailed him to tell him how much he needed to hear this story. That he was on the brink. It's this that keeps her father and  the Foundation pressing forward. \n\nI give to this foundation. I serve this foundation and this cause with my time because our community needs this.

Six years ago, on my first trip to Swaziland, my heart was broken.  Everything I saw led me to the conclusion that life for these rural families is about survival.  This tiny country at the tip of South Africa has one of the highest AIDS/HIV+ rates and lowest life-expectancies in the world.  In a population of less than one million, there are estimated to be more than 140,000 orphans.\n\nLife is difficult.  Most of the Timbali women live without electricity or running water and very little food.  There is no way to explain what seeing, holding and feeling this kind of need does to your heart.  Everything I do to promote this ministry is done with the faces of these struggling mothers and children in mind.\n\nOne of the most admirable things about the women of Timbali Crafts is that they give back despite their own struggles.  The Timbali women are all volunteer cooks at local feeding centers.  They cook one hot meal 6 days a week for the vulnerable children and orphans in their communities.  That meal is the only meal most of the children receive each day.  The 110 women of Timbali Crafts help feed over 3,000 children daily.  The Timbali women also face other hardships; most are either widowed or abandoned, and many are single mothers or grandmothers raising their orphaned grandchildren.\n\nThese women are loving and serving others in their communities.  When I saw the beautiful hand-made Timbali products these women sew I wanted to help them in any way I could.  Every Timbali purchase helps provide a much needed income to enable them to feed their children, pay school fees and meet their family's immediate physical needs.  Timbali Crafts shines with such bright hope and is changing the lives of these hard-working women and their families who would otherwise have little or no resources.\n\nMy family has chosen to lead an active effort to support Timbali Crafts year-round by selling the products that the Timbali women create.  We travel (at least monthly) to sell and promote Timbali Crafts at various conferences and festivals in the Midwest.  It is my privilege to volunteer my time to exhibit at these various events.  All of the money that I receive from selling these crafts goes back to the Timbali ministry.  My payment is seeing the smiling faces of the Timbali women on my return trips to Swaziland.  It is these women who are making a huge difference in thousands of orphans' lives every day.\n\nGiving my time and energy to the Timbali Crafts women and their families has become a passion for me; a way for me to reach out with the love of Christ half-way around the world from Swaziland.\n\nwww.timbalicrafts.org",,

We were just barely making it with only two of us. Not to mention, we had planned to take a few years to enjoy being newly married before starting a family! Over the course of the next 9 months we wrestled with many thoughts and emotions about the pregnancy, not all of which were positive. During that time, I understood for the first time in my life why someone might seriously consider having an abortion. On May 27th, 2012, we welcomed our son Josiah Philip Holdaway. As I grew into motherhood, I thought back on how much I struggled during my pregnancy and how happy I was now to have my son. I began to feel compassion and sorrow for the women who also struggle with the news of unexpected pregnancy and choose to have abortions. What joy these women miss!

I work for a non-profit that has been struggling for years. We are located in Pleasant Hill, California and are a part of the very diverse Bay Area. Here at Rehabilitation Services of Northern California, we work with the frail and disabled and provide day programs for them to participate in. These day care programs help to keep these elders from being sent to a skilled nursing facility and allows them to remain in the comfort of their own home, with their dignity and independence, all while giving their caregivers respite. We have been around since 1949, and are still very unknown to our community. And this is where I answer the question above: No, seniors are not sexy. They are not an appealing demographic for the public to donate to or even pay attention to, hence the struggle to stay open and relevant. \nNo one wants to age, and no one thinks about what is going to happen to them when they age, but we do. We fight for rights for seniors, to ensure they are treated by our government with respect, and are able to keep their livelihood.\nI will end with this question: who thinks of themselves aging, and then thinks of being sent to a nursing home?

When I entered international arrivals in Kathmandu, Nepal, I found the toilets but no toilet paper, lots of eager taxi drivers for hire but not the one I had arranged, and eventually my lodging but no available room. For my first time in Asia, traveling by myself, it briefly crossed my mind that I had made a big mistake.\n\nSpoiler Alert: I hadn’t.\n\nI cleared my allotment of travel trials in those first couple hours, and the rest of my two weeks in Nepal were filled with meaningful experiences, conversations, and true cultural exchange. And it was the nonprofit Restoration Works International (www.restorationworksinternational.org) that made it all possible.\n\nAs a cultural heritage professional, I love old places and I enjoy traveling. But I’ve struggled to find a way to reconcile those two passions with a third: supporting those who are in need. So when I heard about Restoration Works International’s work to support cultural and economic sustainability through the restoration of cultural places in the developing world, I looked into their track record. \n\nI found Restoration Works International had been working in the Chhairo community in Nepal since 2005 to help restore a 300-year-old Buddhist monastery with tangible results. What was a once a crumbling ruin has become the home of young Buddhist monks who arrived in mid-2012. And after many seasons of collaboration between the organization’s volunteers (like me!) and local crews, the monastery has reached the stage where it can be used for ceremonies and celebrations. Many local craftspeople and community members are employed as a result. It’s working! \n\nIt was the most unique “giving back” opportunity I had ever had, and I will never forget it. I didn’t just write a check to support the project, I LIVED it for a couple weeks and left feeling that I had made the right choice in giving my time to Restoration Works International. \n\nMy contributions during the trip were minor in the larger scheme of the project (I was assigned to the gyalpo, a small chapel, to paint an alter and murals with the world-renowned Thangka painter and head lama, Shashi Dhoj Tulachan.) Yet because of the organization’s excellent work, I could support a cause that provides vital employment for Nepalis who otherwise may have made the difficult choice to work dangerous jobs as porters or in construction abroad.

These causes are important to me and I trust that my donations, in some small way, make a difference in some peoples’ lives, even if I never actually see the impact of my donations.  \n Several  years ago, however, I made a donation to a different type of organization, --  Restoration Works International  (www.restorationworksinternational.org/)-- a volunteer vacation nonprofit committed to restoring a historically significant Buddhist monastery in the Himalaya Mountains of Nepal, one of the world’s poorest countries.  For centuries, the monastery, Chhairo Gompa, had been a thriving spiritual and community center for the local Thakali people.   In the mid-20th century, however, after the Communist takeover of neighboring Tibet and the closure of the border, the local economy shriveled and Chhairo Gompa was virtually abandoned and fell into serious disrepair.  Fifty years later, as the local economy slowly began to recover due to tourism, local Thakali leaders partnered with RWI, a U.S.-based non-profit, to restore Chhairo Gompa and reestablish its cultural and symbolic importance to the local community.   \n To raise the necessary funds RWI recruits volunteers like me who donate money and travel  to Nepal as part of a group that works  alongside the local artisans and laborers.  My first donation to RWI and trip to Chhairo Gompa was in 2007. What an experience!  Our group spent twelve unforgettable days at Chhairo.  I did a lot of dirty, strenuous work and it was glorious.  I loved working side-by-side with the locals even though our communication was mainly hand gestures and smiles.  Each day we all had lunch together – dal bhat, the traditional Nepali meal consisting of rice and spicy lentils and sides of vegetables,--prepared by local village ladies.  While we worked, we could often smell incense and hear the chanting of Buddhist rituals being performed at the gompa’s small temple.  Sometimes we watched as the head monk painted brilliant murals on the gompa’s walls.  At Chhairo , not only could I see the immediate  impact of my giving to RWI, I could hear it, smell it, taste it, feel it, live it.\n My experience at Chhairo in 2007 was so meaningful that I returned in 2009 and again in 2012 and 2014.  Witnessing  the progress in restoring this special sanctuary to its former eminence has been extremely gratifying.  Even more rewarding is the knowledge that the work that RWI has done there has profoundly improved the life of this humble and beautiful community.\n",,

In addition, we provide community education programs and work with local schools, media platforms, and local businesses on how to promote healthy relationships with food, exercise, and body image. During my two years with Rock Recovery, I have volunteered as a Mentor, Community Relations & Development Specialist, and a Social Media Manager.

Having the chance to talk to impressionable, young children about their youthful impressions of food, exercise, and body image often also enables us to reach their caregivers. Parents and teachers don't necessarily always realize their own comments on food and exercise impact the children around them. Passing conversation on the newest diet or exercise trend or constant self-critique on one's own weight or physique often becomes ingrained and repeated by children. Having grown up surrounded by passing comments by adults around me, I became preoccupied at a very young age with my own body. By middle school, I was restricting. By high school, I was overexercising and incorporating other dangerous disordered eating behaviors into my lifestyle. While the adults around me certainly did not cause my eating disorder, their comments and own behaviors certainly contributed to my own negative relationship with food, exercise and body image at a young age. \n\nMy own experiences with an eating disorder has made it even more meaningful to me to not only volunteer within the eating disorder community and ensure that affordable and accessible treatment is available to those who need it, but to particularly engage with younger demographics and try to prevent disordered eating behaviors and promote healthy relationships with food, exercise, and body image from a young age.",,

On Father's Day in 1998, he passed away. In the interim, he suffered a brutal surgery and painful chemotherapy and radiation treatments.  I was quoted on RefluxMD's website as saying that he suffered a surgery so bad that I don't 'know how anyone – whether they were 70 years old or 17 years old – would have survived it.” \n\nIt wasn't until 15 years later that we felt the same fear that we had felt when my grandfather was first diagnosed.  My mother, his daughter, began to experience some of the same symptoms my grandfather did right before he was diagnosed.  After coercing my mother and her GI doctor to get screened, we learned that while there was a small amount of damage to her esophagus due to acid reflux, she was cancer free.  Thank God!\n\nAt the time of my grandfather's passing, we knew nothing about esophageal cancer. It wasn't until after my mother’s endoscopy that we began researching further into it. What we found was horrible! \n\nNot only had incidence of esophageal cancer skyrocketed 600% in the past decades, it became the fastest growing cancer in the United States and other western countries. \nIt is also one of the deadliest, as was the case with my grandfather; there are rarely symptoms of early stage esophageal cancer.  Symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, chronic indigestion, sensation of food getting stuck and chest pain usually occur once the cancer has spread and becomes difficult, if not impossible, to treat.\n\nAttributing to the poor mortality rate is the fact that there are no routine or standard screenings to detect esophageal cancer in its earliest stages.  There is also very little awareness regarding risk factors and symptoms of esophageal cancer.   Lastly, we found that research of esophageal cancer is extremely underfunded.\n\nAt first, we looked into joining other charities already established to help fight this cancer. Unfortunately, upon researching financial information and effectiveness, we didn't like what we saw. Other nonprofits, in our opinion, weren't utilizing their resources effectively.  The only way that we could ensure that our efforts would be going directly to the cause was to start our own charity.  \n\nOn November 21, 2011, my grandfather's birthday, The Salgi Esophageal Cancer Research Foundation was established.  On February 21, 2012, we received our tax exemption status from the IRS.  \n\nWhile it has not been an easy feat to establish and run a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charity without the help of an attorney, accountant or other fundraising professionals, it has undoubtedly been the right decision. \n\nUpon creating The Salgi Esophageal Cancer Research Foundation, we immediately started receiving requests for funding of esophageal cancer research from medical groups throughout the United States.  We also began to meet and connect with other families and individuals who had been affected by this cancer.  Speaking with these people and receiving these requests mirrored the same grievances that we felt (and still feel) and validated our mission. \n\nAs with many other start-ups, be it nonprofits or for profit organizations, the first few years are most definitely the hardest.  \n\nFortunately, we never gave up.  Instead, we leaped and sometimes stumbled over every hurdle.  We persevered and thanks to our community of supporters, we are persevering.\n\nIn less than five years our charity has fulfilled all three of the missions that we set out to accomplish.   We raised national and international awareness, encouraged early detection and funded research.  In July 2015, The Salgi Esophageal Cancer Research Foundation awarded its very first grant to esophageal cancer research.  This would absolutely not have been possible without our donors and supporters.  \n\nWhile we have made great accomplishments, there is a long road ahead of us.  Esophageal cancer is still considered one of the fastest and deadliest cancers; research funding is still critically low and there are still no standard or routine tests to improve early detection and increase survival.   However, we will continue to make a difference and do so in honor of all the brave men and women who have been affected by this horrible cancer.   I know my grandfather will be cheering us on in heaven.\n\n",,

However, when I moved to San Antonio in May 2013, I quickly learned my new city had a major pet overpopulation problem and a shelter that had to kill due to the sheer number of abandoned animals. I accidentally ended up in a low-income area, and my new neighborhood had many unfixed pets roaming around, plus some pets being abused. One small dog down the street was tied to a stake in the front yard on a short leash, and was there 24/7. His only shelter was a broken file cabinet the owners used as a makeshift doghouse, and after a major storm, it was in shambles. They appeared very low-income and weren't willing to fix the problem. I decided to take action and posted an ad on Craigslist seeking someone willing to give a free doghouse to this neglected dog. A kind woman offered to give me her doghouse. We met up and she not only gave me a doghouse, but a big bag of food and a shopping bag full of toys, blankets, and goodies for the dog--plus a gift card to a pet store, all for this family. She was so generous and giving to this family and dog she'd never even met. I told her I was having a hard time seeing how many strays were in San Antonio and how many animals were abused and neglected, and she educated me about how we were a kill city, but told me about organizations like San Antonio Pets Alive that making a huge difference in how many pets were euthanized. She encouraged me to get involved, so I went home and signed up. I didn't know how much I'd fall in love with the organization and get very involved. I fostered a dog with them that I ended up bonding with immediately, and we adopted him, and he now lives in my lap all day, every day (I work from home).

Locked inside with the towels and scented soaps, I noticed the telephone on the counter. This was the 80s, and a phone in the bathroom was an uncommon sight.  Without that phone to call my dad, and the parents of the boy I was babysitting – I could have become one of accidental shooting statistics now reported weekly across the United States. \n \nThirty-plus years later, I am the mother of two school aged children.  Like many, I reached new levels of despair open learning that 28 people were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown CT.  The shooter, Adam Lanza committed matricide, followed by murdering twenty children ages 7 and younger, six school staff members, and then committed suicide.    \n\nIn the three years following Sandy Hook, I got involved in the cause to reduce gun violence.  To me, this meant being vocal about my stance on gun law reform.  I donated to the advocacy group founded by Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly, following her survival of an Arizona Mass Shooting.  I posted my views on Facebook, I spoke with friends and family.  I thought I was doing enough.\n\nOn October 1, 2015 – a shooter at Umpqua Community College stormed the campus killing nine and committing suicide in the process.  This time upon hearing the news, something changed.  I questioned what good I was doing.  I doubted how throwing money at advocacy groups, and voicing my opinion on Facebook was making a difference.  But what had really changed was….I wasn’t horrified.   In fact, I felt numb.  I became fearful of desensitization.  Was I indifferent?  In an attempt to rally myself back to a place of being shocked – I watched a documentary produced by Nightline regarding the NRA’s rise to power.  I’d hoped I would recharge my resolve, and generate new ideas on how to “solve our gun violence” problem.  \n\nBut instead, I sat broken.  Defeated.  \n\nIt’s no use.  The NRA has won.  Americans, we love our guns.  We can’t win.  It’s over. \n\nHead in hands, I cried and quit the fight.  \n\nThe next morning, as a brand new day often does, I found myself staring at an opportunity.  With Facebook’s Suggested Page fairies sprinkling their pixie dust on my screen – a beautiful green tree – with leaves made of handprints caught my eye.  I spent the next several hours educating myself on the Sandy Hook Promise (www.sandyhookpromise.org), and rediscovered my soul.  \n\nSandy Hook Promise spoke to me, in a way that other efforts hadn’t been able to.  It provided a vehicle for volunteering my time, not just my money and social network.  I could get directly involved in my community.  \n\nI loved how Sandy Hook Promise’s programs were heavily weighted on prevention – not waging war on gun lobbies or alienating responsible gun owners. \n\nI loved that the focus was on mental health first aid programs.  That the definition of gun violence was inclusive of suicide prevention & unintentional shootings.  That the programs are predominately youth led.   Volunteering and spending time with kids – teaching them how to be inclusive of other kids, how to recognize mental crisis in their friends and classmates, how to #saysomething to a trusted adult when they have witnessed a potential sign, signal or threat of gun violence.  This spoke to me. That tattling and looking out for your friends and classmates are different.  That we need to have a plan for kids, which they can easily follow, should they encounter a firearm unexpectedly.  That we open the dialogue with youth on these issues, not brush the tough talks under the rug. \n\nI loved that Sandy Hook Promise’s legislative philosophy is based on upholding the rights of gun owners, while advocating for gun safety, gun lethality (magazine size) and that reducing gun violence is not solely about the gun – that Mental Health advocacy, education and programs are key components.  \n\nI signed on as a Promise Leader.  A Promise Leader makes the commitment to be an active participate in their community, to bring the Sandy Hook Promise programs to schools, youth centers, places of worship, and any other community organization where we can educate the public on Mental Health First Aid, and other prevention programs like #saysomething, #startwithhello #Keepitsecureandsafelystored (Kiss).  That as a Promise Leader, I will educate other adults on the programs and how to get involved. \n\nBefore I donated financially, I decided it was time to donate that most valuable of all resources – time.  I created a plan for how I was going to get involved with Sandy Hook Promise within my community, starting with the local middle and elementary schools my children attend.  \n\nSitting in my son’s middle school principal’s office, I was fearful that he would view me as “an overly involved, helicopter parent”.  I presented my reasons for signing on as a Promise Leader and that I wanted to get our middle school, and other schools involved with Sandy Hook Promise Programs.  That I felt our public school systems were already strapped, and thin on time and resources, and that I wanted to be “the heavy lifter” to help get Sandy Hook Promise off the ground running for them.   \n\nAs I sat looking at my son’s principal, nervous about what he would say, he began slowly, “Penny, this cause is one that is near and dear to my heart.  We are all very concerned that something like this could happen here, in fact, our demographic is not necessarily an if it’s going to happen in some ways it’s a when.  Our school already had one lock-down due to a man in a nearby neighborhood brandishing a shotgun as he walked through the streets, so I really want to support this, and in fact have some ideas on how you can get started.”  \n\nThe look on his face, of surprise and gratitude that a parent would want to help them in this way – answered any doubts.  It felt good to show them how much I value all their hard work in caring for our community’s kids. \n\nHe gave me unlimited access to the staff, suggested a small taskforce of teachers and administrators, communicated with them that this was something they were to get involved in.  He asked me to get involved with the student led News Network and the elected student body and council.  He wanted the programs to be student led – which provided me a huge sigh of relief, wondering how I was going to pull this all off with a full time job, a family to raise, and a 90-lb German shepherd nipping at my feet. \n\nWe are now in full swing preparing for our first “Say Something” week.  A week of inclusion and education events which will dovetail with other positive behavior programs that our county has rolled out to districts county-wide.  \n\nDespite all this “doing” and “action” and “communicating” – the biggest gift I’ve received from volunteering for Sandy Hook Promise- is the return of hope.  \n\nThat a group of families, who experienced devastating loss, could redirect their grief, for the greater good and provide an unwavering example of forgiveness – I am deeply humbled and grateful for each and every one of them. \n \nI owe Sandy Hook Promise so much in return. \n\n\n\n\n",,

I am inspired to give when I know that those involved in an organization are just as passionate as I am about an issue. Saving Our Sisters is a non-profit program dedicated to providing support to mothers who otherwise are left feeling like they have no choice but to relinquish their baby to adoption. Saving Our Sisters is a nationwide network of people who donate their time, energy and efforts of supporting the mothers. All of the work is done on a voluntary basis and 100% of the proceeds go directly to providing needed items.\n\nSo often, many pregnant women may feel that adoption is the only option they have, but with support, they find that they can keep their baby and successfully parent. It is so incredible to witness how the love within this nationwide network can make such a difference for these families! Frequently, what is needed is something as simple as diapers and wipes. Other times, an infant car seat or soothing swing is needed. It is amazing how receiving just a few of these needed items can make all the difference for the moms. \n\nSometimes moms need support or direction in finding resources so that she can continue her education or find housing. So often, she just needs to know that she’ll have the guidance to find independence and the friendship of someone in the network who is close by. Many of us who have been moms know the value in having someone say, “Yes, you can do this.” \n\nSaving Our Sisters is a nonprofit program through Concerned United Birthparents and more information can be found at:  http://cubirthparents.org/\n",,

Our mentors provide stable, long-term relationships for the students and help them develop and maintain positive attitudes towards school. \nSince 2006, Seedling Foundation has served over 1600 students, with a presence at one time or another on 150+ campuses in 11 districts and 16 charter schools in Austin and Central Texas. Our current return rate for mentors is 74%, and their satisfaction rate is always in the high 90th percentile. \nI gave generously to Seedling, of course, and always knew that my dollars were going to change children's lives, but one day my husband and I were talking about these kids we were serving and it occurred to us that WE could do more.\nWhat if?\nWhat if a child, challenged by parental incarceration with all of the chaos and uncertainty that brings, was given the opportunity to win a college scholarship? And better yet, what if they had that opportunity BEFORE they entered high school? \nWe wanted to remove some of the barriers these kids face by awarding the scholarship at the end of 8th grade, allowing them to walk into high school as scholarship winners, with all of the confidence and hope for the future we hoped it would provide. We removed the barrier of a minimum GPA - they just needed to graduate and get accepted to the 2-4 year program of their choice. We even made it flexible, so that kids who needed a little more time got it, and were able to graduate late and still receive their scholarship. \nWe got excited about this possibility and brought it to the Board and Staff of Seedling. They got excited too, and so in the spring of 2007, I had the privilege of awarding two Seedling College Scholarships to 8th graders in the mentoring program.\nThese students had to fill out an application (much like the ones they would see in high school), write an essay about mentoring and how they felt about it, and get a recommendation letter from their mentor. It is a real-world experience and they took it seriously.\nSince 2007, we have seen the college scholarship program grow as more people caught the vision and joined us in funding them.\nAs of 2015, thirty-one students have been awarded scholarships totaling over $150,000, and eleven have fulfilled the promise we saw in them so long ago. They graduated from high school, and have attended University of Texas, UT-San Antonio, Aurora University, Sul Ross State University, Angelo State University, The Chemical Dependency Institute, The American Academy of Dramatic Arts and Austin Community College.\nAs a donor, there is nothing more exciting than seeing the blossoms of your giving come to full flower. \nWhen our first 2007 winners/2011 graduates were recognized at the Seedling Mentor Appreciation Event that May, and 400 people jumped to their feet to give them a standing ovation, I could see them vibrate with excitement and the hope of a great future. \nThis is why I give and why I mentor, and I hope someday to see my little third grade mentee walk across that stage and receive her Seedling College Scholarship.

Tipton, the lilac point Siamese that I rescued from the shelter at which I volunteered, was just eight years old and had only been in my life for a year and a half. I vowed that after so much heartbreak in such a short time, I would never have another pet even though I was a life-long animal lover. It wasn’t long before I realized, though, that coming home to an empty house felt lonely and cold.\n\nI began my search online to find another Siamese because I loved Tippy’s personality. My search brought me to the Siamese Cat Rescue Center (www.siameserescue.org). In addition to a center in Locust Dale, Va., the organization houses rescued cats at foster homes located across the southeast.\n\nWithin a month, I had found the perfect pair of Siamese siblings to add to my family. I not only adored these two wonderful furry beings that quickly took over my home and my life, but I was amazed at the people within the organization that I met along the way. As it is with many reputable animal rescue groups, it wasn’t a simple process to adopt, but it was well worth it. Each person I encountered during the adoption process – from the intake evaluators to the interviewers and the fosters– cared so deeply about placing every cat under their care with the right family. \n\nNot long after the adoption, I began to think about how best to express my gratitude to the center. The way that best fit my schedule was to become a Siamese Cat Rescue Center transport driver. Known as the “Meezer Express,” I am now part of a team of volunteers that drive cats from foster homes to their new forever homes all over the southeastern part of the United States. Trips like these take place nearly every weekend and volunteers can participate as often or as little as they like. It’s an important job. If there aren’t enough available volunteers in each area, the cats don’t get to go home that weekend.\n\nSome days the trip is as simple as just three legs to get the cats home and others take a huge team of people to get the job done. Some trips I meet only the drivers of the next leg of the trip to transfer my precious cargo and on special days, I am able to be the person who hands over the new family member(s) to the adopters. Those are pretty amazing days.\n\nSince I joined the Meezer Express, I have been a part of 34 trips, have logged over 10,000 miles and have helped more than 50 cats find new forever homes.\nI am honored to be a part of this organization. And though, admittedly, we aren’t out there saving the world, we are out there saving the lives of every cat that we transport, more often than not, more than one at a time. And just as importantly, we bring love to people who need it and often help to heal hearts that have once been broken, just like mine was.\n",,

To see their smiling faces and to hear of the successes they've had with the ministry is humbling to us.  We are moved by the way these children show such motivation and are able to achieve so much despite having so few resources. It is clear to us that God's hand is at work when we see how fruitful this ministry has been. \n\nAs Catholics, we strive to live as Christ lived, and to answer His call to love one another.

I learned that not only did the singing boost the children's sense of self-esteem, but it also acted as a form of speech therapy that the kids actually enjoyed doing.\n\nAfter the joyous singing and dancing came to end, a group of us drove out of the city to visit with Jasmine, a seventeen-year-old single mother of two. The newest addition to her family, a six-week-old baby boy name Ivan, was born with a cleft lip and palate. This was not caught during her routine ultrasound so it came as a total surprise, leaving Jasmine wondering what to do or where to even start.\n\nAt that very moment all I could think about was my son Conrad who was born with a bilateral cleft lip. My wife Allie and I were also caught off guard as we knew of nobody in our family that was born with a cleft. Our doctor at that time mentioned that a bilateral cleft could be indicative of Down syndrome, so we didn’t know what to expect or prepare for. Although we sympathized greatly with Ivan’s mother considering our similar situation, we reassured her that everything was going to be fine because she was in good hands with Smile Train. We even showed before and after photos of Conrad's surgery so she could get a sense of what to expect.\n\nWe're happy to say, little Ivan has received his first surgery. Allie and I are hoping to make it back down to Mexico City to assist in any way and be there for support. It's safe to say that Ivan will need some additional surgeries, but with Smile Train's outreach and ability to create sustainable ways to repair clefts, he's most certainly set up for success.\nIt was great to see firsthand that Smile Train is there to help turn those dreams into a reality. I am happy that I was also able to share my story with one of Smile Train’s patients while in Mexico, giving them comfort in knowing that they are not alone.

This trip came about from my desire to help those less fortunate by giving of my time and resources.  \n\nDue to limited vacation time, I had to take time off work without pay for the 10-day trip.  Fortunately, I was the one who received an enormous “payment” of a once-in-a-lifetime adventure where I was able to experience sights and sounds that I never would have noticed in my safe, routine life.  A few of those “payments” included:\n\n--The joy and laughter of children turning ordinary plastic Wal-Mart bags into kites by adding a string to it, and then running all over the school yard watching the “kites” blowing in the sky.\n--A new sense of appreciation for fresh and packaged meats after seeing meats left out for hours and covered with flies in their open market.  \n--Transforming a baby at the orphanage, ill with Tuberculosis, from her “fog” of just sitting on the floor alone and without toys or personal attention into a smiling, laughing baby that lit up after human touch, eye contact and interactive play with toys we provided.

I thought I would share my story of how important this agency is to me and my community.\nThere are many levels of poor – I lived in a few of them. I came from a family of college educated, middle class school teachers and everything was good in my life. Then, in 1970 my father suddenly died and left my mother with 4 children, grades 6th through 11th, to support on her own. My eldest sibling graduated the following May and moved on to a college campus. My brother moved in with friends to finish high school while my mother, sister and I moved to another state to be closer my grandma. We were introduced to low-income and were learning how to survive together. I went to work at 13 to help Mom with expenses, and we just made it work. Then it was my turn to go to college - which I did. I soon fell in love - and thought he had too, until I became pregnant.  You know how that story goes – I became a very young, single parent.  I quit school to go work so I could support myself and my child. Since I worked in the restaurant business through high school, waiting tables and cooking was the employment skill I fell back on. Since the wages I received did not support me and my baby, I applied and received food stamps, and child welfare. These programs were not the total answer, but they sure did help me buy TV dinners, diapers and formula that were affordable - and I felt it was better than nothing, and we were surviving!\nI really, really wanted a different job – one with better hours so I could spend more time with my son. I worked crazy hours and had to pick up shifts whenever they were available. I had no training to do other work, and I had no confidence that the restaurant skills I had could get me a better job.  One day someone asked me if I knew about the job programs the local Community Action Agency administered to our small community.  I applied. I will never forget the job program worker who took my application - she tutored me in confidence. She told me that just because I was a single mother did not mean I was not worthy of a good job. Period. She lifted my spirits immediately and gave me HOPE. That program was life-changing for me.\nI have certainly worked my way up since then - and it all started because of the training program I went to. I got a job at the Family Resource Center taking applications for the many programs that were offered. Next I went to work as the Office Deputy for the Howard County Sheriff’s Department. My skills had grown so much that I then applied - and was appointed - by Gov. Mel Carnahan to run our local License Bureau for the Mo Department of Revenue. But my ambition did not stop there. In 2006 I ran for the Howard County Treasurer’s office and WON! I won two elections after that, and I am still the Howard County Treasurer today.  \nI will always be thankful to that job program worker who told me I was worth it, and that I could do whatever I wanted in life - it was up to me. She told me that day “this program will get your foot in the door BUT, you will have to get the other foot in there and do the work to change your future”. She was right – those programs empowered me – and empowered many, many more. Thank you, CMCA\n",,

Showing up to an apartment complex slightly off campus, with absolutely no way to communicate to the grandmother at the door except by nervous laughter and crazy gestures. On top of that, the only person who speaks English is a 6-year-old that informs us his neighbor will be home at “3:75.” This encapsulates what happens during the first interaction Bridge Builders have with their new ‘family’. Bridge Builders is a program run through the Refugee Community Partnership (RCP). This program strives to forge bonds between two very different communities: college students and families from Burma. Most volunteers upon entering the program know very little about Burma or the refugee community in Chapel Hill. \n\nThroughout the Bridge Builders program, we’ve had two different families. We’ve helped switch auto insurance companies, fix bugged computers, worked with social services, taught English, and played more than a few solid games of Charades. With our combined experiences as Bridge Builders we can both agree that we don’t subscribe to the traditional idea of what giving is. The relationship here isn’t one sided and there is no set giver and receiver. RCP emphasizes that although we may have more knowledge about life in America, we are learning just as much from our families as they are from us. We’ve learned which spices will burn your tongue, the traditions and celebrations within the culture, how to communicate with someone when the only thing you both understand is a smile, and how amazing it is to be a part of community that extends far beyond campus borders. Differences are arbitrary when the similarities outweigh them; through shared experiences and patience we dissolve all barriers of language, culture, age, and gender. We all love our family, eagerly wait to see them excel, and seek to experience joy. \n\nWith this experience in our hearts, we became more involved with Bridge Builders as assistant program directors. RCP was founded in order to address the many disparities that the refugee families face; the Bridge Builders program is one direct way to help families with their transition. It focuses on empowering them with the skills to become self-sufficient. We have helped volunteers and families access local resources in addition to planned trainings that benefit the community focusing on common issues such as traffic violations and domestic violence. \n\nRCP is about mutual understanding and community, both of which the world could use a bit more of right now. Giving is about reaching out to others and overcoming language barriers and perceived cultural boundaries. Giving is a two-way relationship.

From the images you see what looks like occasional grey warehouses and trees dotted along the side of brown roads. It kind of looks like nothing much is there. The reality is something quite different. Murang'a is vibrant, noisy and colorful. The streets are tightly packed with brightly hand painted shops and businesses all imaginatively named and unique (a favorite one spotted last night was the 'Meat Garden Hotel').\nBike taxis buzz around the town - a 6km ride from Murang'a to Roko costs around 60p. The bikes are all fabulous extensions of their driver... Extensively decorated with slogans and bright flashing lights they often look a party on two wheels. \nThe edges of the streets in the center are lined with men and women all selling their produce on wooden pallets. Avocados (4 massive ones for £0.30p), thorn melon, passion fruit, sweet potato, cabbages, onions, oranges etc etc - all beautiful and fresh. People are honest about their prices and very friendly - in among the hustle and bustle you can always catch people singing or laughing together.\nThe other thing you can't see from the images online is the color of the actual earth. The best way to describe it is like intense cocoa. It's bright and deep in color - a bit like you have put a bright color filter on Instagram on it. In the sunshine it reminded Cassius of the dusting you get on 'top of a posh chocolate truffle'. He's spot on.\nBack to today..... I spent the morning visiting each class doing music sessions. I caught a quick break for a lunch of beans and kale with Cassius, Job and the cat followed by a practice with the teachers for their song for Thursday's concert. All the teachers were amazing - we worked on some harmonies and movement and will perform Jambo Bwana on Thursday.... All the kids had their noses pressed against the windows very excited to see their teachers Margaret, Merci, Caroline, Dorcas and Zipporah in action, and Cassius and Job supervised the kids.\nAt 2pm the whole school met up for group practice and with another planned tomorrow we will hopefully be ready for Thursday!\nEach day speeds by with so much going on and Cass is working at breakneck speed trying to get the blue house finished in time for Thursday too...

The event was also attended by Michelle, Buddy and Blake who hail from Texas, USA. They have been great supporters of Roko and have helped with everything from providing dentists, doctors and even wiring the school in preparation for when electricity is available in the area.\nRoko made sure that each and every child received a small end of term gift and after the ceremony bags of donated shoes and sandals were lined up so that the kids could start next term with new shoes. Much excitement ensued with children showing off their new footwear. There was lots of tearing around after balloons we had put up on the buildings and the kids were thrilled with chocolate we had bought for each of the kids. To quote one of the girls from the Rescue Centre - Stellah - 'Today has been a good day... a good good day'.\nAfter the last of the kids departed in the late afternoon we were all knackered after such a long day. We headed into Murang'a to grab some food and pretty much collapsed into bed as soon as we got back to school. Today has been quiet in comparison - I can’t believe we are leaving in the morning. I managed some of our washing, attempted to cook on the fires in the kitchen and painted the bases of the last of the classroom buildings. After we leave Cyber' tonight s we plan to pop into the Rescue and Kenwa homes to say our farewells to the sponsored children.\nComing to Kenya and being part of such an inspirational project has been such a fabulous experience for both me and Cassius.

From Switzerland to Japan, the United States to Germany, India to Canada, I have witnessed how xenophobia drives wedges of prejudice and misunderstanding between human beings. I have experienced how the concentration of melanin in your skin often determines how others with different melanin levels value you, no matter what you contribute or are capable of contributing to humanity.\n\nWhen I was 3 years old my father decided to move to Halifax, Canada to pursue a Master’s degree, after having worked in the best national research laboratory and graduated from one of the most outstanding technical universities in India. But my father’s Professor would not give him a job as a teaching assistant, because he deemed my father not intelligent enough. Instead, the Professor hired a teaching assistant with few credentials except his color. This teaching assistant received a healthy stipend, even though he surreptitiously went for help to my father, who was paid nothing.\n\nAs an 11-year old in Germany I was the only non-German child in my Gymnasium (the school for the highest achievers in the 3-tiered German school system) at a time when the small town we lived in had a large Turkish population. I asked one of my teachers why there were no Turkish children in my school. He told me that they were not as capable as German children and so were sent to the ‘Hauptschule’ (the school for the lowest achievers). Even as an 11-year old I understood that being shunted into the ‘Hauptschule’ was a life sentence of low-paying trade jobs.\n\nWhen I was in graduate school at an Ivy League university in the United States, I was once riding in the elevator with one of my professors, who later received the Nobel Prize. He was speaking with one of his colleagues, telling him about a conference he had attended in India recently: “What a waste of time. There is no innovation in India. The only time a few of those smelly Indians do anything useful is when they come here to learn from us.” To my chagrin this professor turned to me and said: “I’m sure you agree.”\n\nThese are only three stories out of hundreds, if not thousands, that shaped my worldview as a child. I pledged to myself that I would devote my life to achieving excellence myself (so that differently colored people would have a difficult time undervaluing and obstructing me) and then drawing out the innovation potential of those individuals and communities, who have been subjected to prejudicial undervaluation and marginalization.\n\nThus, after earning the Burroughs Wellcome Fund Career Award in the Biomedical Sciences for being one of the most innovative and excellent young scientists in North America, I returned the bulk of the $500,000 award that I had been given to start up my own research laboratory at an established academic institution, and instead set out to found my own non-profit institution with no resources but my determination. \n\nI wanted to create an institution that not only draws on the astounding diversity of human ideas and innovations across the world to solve real problems affecting a wide spectrum of humans and ecosystems, but that ensures a high quality of life for each human individual and community, regardless of their genetic, geographic, or socio-economic origins. I wanted to devote my life to ensuring that people would not be undervalued, exploited, and excluded merely because of their origins.\n\nI founded the Śramani Institute with the mission of realizing the inter-connected wellbeing of all human beings, especially those marginalized, within their ecological, economic, and cultural contexts. Our approach to fulfilling our mission would be to create, facilitate, and promote intellectual and technological innovations that ensure Equitably Sustainable Progress* and are based on the scientific-analytical methods of diverse Knowledge & Technology (KT) Frameworks.\n\nI knew that to be effective I had to understand how innovation is valued, protected, and marketed in the global economy. So I enrolled myself in law school, while I worked full-time as a scientific advisor (and later as an attorney) in various Intellectual Property law firms. In my ‘spare time’ I established the Śramani Institute in three countries: Canada in 2010, the United States in 2011, and India in 2012. I kept working full-time as an attorney so that I could fund the institution. My nights, weekends, and holidays, I spent training my staff, conducting research and fieldwork, making connections, handling legal and administrative matters, and supervising the implementation of our initiatives.\n\nI poured all of my life savings and all of my earnings, save my own frugal food and accommodation expenses, into the Śramani Institute to pay for our infrastructure costs, field work expenses, staff salaries, community funds, travel, etc. In late 2014, because my staff needed more guidance from me, I quit my paying job as an attorney to dedicate myself entirely to the Śramani Institute, even though I only had enough money saved up to suffice for just 1 year of food and lodging for my family.\n\nOver the past 5 years, I have personally worked with extraordinary tribal communities in various parts of India, who each have developed fascinating Knowledge & Technology (KT) Frameworks, which form the bases of sophisticated socially & environmentally sustainable innovations. Each adult in these communities has developed expertise and innovates in at least 4-6 different areas: food technologies, medicines, biodiversity preservation, architecture, civil engineering, microclimate manipulation, education, etc. The innovative capacity and knowledge base of these human beings never ceases to amaze me. Yet these extraordinary people are devalued and marginalized into the non-mainstream. They have been evicted by the government from their original ecosystems. They have been made dependent on social welfare and charity. And they have been forced to work under inhuman and dangerous conditions as indentured laborers.\n\nIt is these remarkable people that have kept me motivated to continue devoting my time, energy, and money to the Śramani Institute. As a means to help them, I spearheaded the development of AVISH™ (Augmenting Vigor of Innovation through Structural Harmonization). AVISH™ enables the prediction of the quantity, quality, and nature of the Vigor of Innovation (VI™) of an individual, community, or organization. AVISH™ also enables the creation of customized training & education programs designed specifically to draw out and augment VI™.\n\nhttp://www.svevak.org/#!articles/c1inh\n\nThrough AVISH™ the Śramani Institute draws out the inherent capacity of individuals and communities to innovate and encourages them to develop and implement innovations that are equitably sustainable* and range from agricultural methods to healthcare, and resource management to civil engineering. \n\nThe Śramani Institute has already developed and applied AVISH™ in two different settings: (1) working with marginalized, non-mainstream, indigenous communities in the areas of Equitably Sustainable* development and employment; and (2) working with postgraduate (Bachelor's degree or higher) students in the areas of higher education, health, and employment.\n\nThe Śramani Institute is in the process of cementing partnerships with universities and non-mainstream communities in India, Canada, and the United States to further refine and implement AVISH™, with the goal of expanding our work to other countries in the near future.\n\nI would greatly appreciate an opportunity to tell the story of the Śramani Institute and our work in building an equitably sustainable* world at the Dec. 1 Gates Social Media Meetup in Washington D.C.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nKakoli Mitra\n---\n*The Śramani Institute defines Equitably Sustainable Progress as: ‘implementing a set of interconnected diverse thoughts and actions that build a world where human beings of all socio-economic and geographic affiliations are healthy and safe, have access to relevant and uncorrupted education and resources, can engage in dignified livelihoods leading to self-reliance, and are respected for who they choose to express themselves to be.’",,

Right away you start thinking about whether that new bundle of joy will be a boy or a girl. You and your significant other start tossing around names and nursery colors. You nickname the baby 'bean' or 'squishy' or some silly little thing that floods your heart with warmth each time you say it. You fall completely in love with a tiny little being that you will not meet for another 9 months. \n\nFor me and my Sweet Grace Ministries family, it is a quite different experience. We are family of Mommas and Daddies who never got to take that little baby we loved so much home. Our stories are all different, yet they are all the same. Loss. Deep, deep loss. \n\nMy story is mild compared to some of the ones shared at Sweet Grace's monthly support group. I lost my first three pregnancies in the first trimester. For me a positive pregnancy test means calling doctors, ordering medicine, weekly doctor appoints, extra ultrasounds, high risk doctors and an obscene number of blood draws. There is not the floating joy that most people feel. There is worry. There are walls built. There is fear. Fear that you will not get to bring this baby home from the hospital either. That you will leave empty. Empty handed. Empty hearted. \n\nI traveled my journey of losses alone. I did not know about Sweet Grace until I was pregnant with my fourth pregnancy, my first successful one. Through a friend's loss of her precious baby boy just shy of 20 weeks gestation, I started following Sweet Grace Ministries on Facebook. So when my mom called me and told me that my brother and his girlfriend had lost my nephew full term, I reached out to them. I'm not sure how to explain the pain I feel as aunt who lost her precious nephew before she even got to meet him. I cannot fully explain what it is like sitting in a dark delivery room all day watching your baby brother and his girlfriend prepare to deliver their first child knowing they will go home empty handed. I'm not sure how to explain what it is like to see a tiny little casket with a tiny spray of flowers get lowered into a tiny hole in the ground. As a family, we had huge holes punched through our hearts. Where do we go from here? How can we possible go on after such great loss? I'm not sure I could have answered these questions if it was not for Sweet Grace Ministries. \n\n Sweet Grace offered us a photographer to come to the hospital and take pictures of sweet baby Axel. It is the best gift anyone could have given us. We have beautiful, professional portraits of my nephew to cherish and remember him by. When the photographer came, she also brought a basket that Sweet Grace gives to parents who are leaving the hospital empty handed. It included some books on the loss of a baby, a soothing candle and tea, a precious handmade blanket and hat, a lovely remembrance bracelet (one for baby and Momma) and a plush teddy bear among other things to help honor the precious baby that never made it home. \n\nSweet Grace not only gives baskets and photography, they offer grief doulas, miscarriage bags, resources, and most importantly they offer a family. A family of other parents who have experienced miscarriage, still birth and neonatal death. A family who meets once a month to be raw with one another. To share our grief with people who truly understand. To share our deepest fears and thoughts. To carry a little piece of each other's pain. A family to walk this journey of grief with. \n\nSweet Grace Ministries is a nonprofit that I wish did not have to exist, but I am so glad it does. \n\nYou can check out Sweet Grace at http://sweetgraceministries.com/ to learn more about what they provide, to see their heart, and to hear the story of how Sweet Grace was started.

I love living here, it's calm and beautiful by the lake and so nice to see all of the wildlife this area still has to offer. Once I lived here for a few months, I've noticed the large amount of stray dogs in this area. It always breaks my heart to see one of these sweet pups out by themselves near busy roads or in cold winter weather. After rescuing a puppy and successfully finding him a home, we found ourselves in a very bad situation six months after. The road into our neighborhood is fairly secluded and apparently a favorite spot for heartless, careless people to dump dogs. In the Fall of 2013 someone dumped 4 Chihuahua mix dogs in one night, only to be followed by 3 more Terrier mix dogs the following week. All of them were terrified and would not come to us, even for treats. We've tried for weeks and feared for their life each and every night we could not catch them. We made a make shift camp out of an old dog house and a pallet to ensure that these pups had a place to sleep and to keep them warm as we were now facing cold winter temperatures. We went thru a litter with one of the moms only to find them missing one morning. We've kept them all alive throughout the winter and in the Spring they finally started coming around with more and more time spent at their hiding spot. At that point I had reached out to numerous no-kill shelters, rescue organizations, capture organizations and even the news station; nobody was returning my calls and emails. Then, I stumbled across Texas Best Animal Choices Rescue and reached out to them. They were willing to help and took in the Chihuahuas and got them adopted into loving homes. One of the Terrier mixes had already started trusting me in the fall and I was fostering her (well at this time, it was a 'foster failure' and she was enjoying being a permanent part of our family. The other two Terriers were still on the loose and one of them was pregnant and would not let us catch her. Then one day, we got lucky with her sister and she also went to Texas Best Choices Animal Rescue only to be adopted one week later by one of my neighbors that had helped tremendously in her capture. The last Terrier mix was still hesitant and once she finally let us touch her, we've noticed that she had given birth to her puppies but we could not find them anywhere. She didn't look engorged, so we knew that she was nursing and had them hidden somewhere. We kept following her after feeding her daily and we finally figured out that she had walked down a steep hill/cliff and found a cave to hide her puppies in. Even though it was quite a challenge, we found our way down there but weren't able to grab the puppies. The next day, we came back with my 11 year old son in tow and he was able to crawl half way into the cave and hand me one puppy after the next. We put them all into my backpack so that we could safely get them up the cliff and into my truck along with mom and off to Texas Best Choices Animal Rescue. Again, they helped us get all of the pups adopted and mom ended up also being adopted by my neighbor. :)\n\nSince that day, we've become best friends with Allan and Karen, the founders of Texas Best Choices Animal Rescue. We go and volunteer at the Rescue and walk the dogs and socialize the scared ones. We tend to their scars and leash train them to get them ready for their new life in a furever home. Texas Best Choices Animal Rescue usually has around 130 dogs to care for and is the only no-kill dog rescue in this area. They are not supported by any government funding and can only sustain from donations and adoption fees. We have since saved approximately 15 more dogs and Texas Best Choices Animal Rescue has helped us with all of them.

I did this in hopes of opening a dialog with those around me about charity work and where we choose to donate.

It also means that we don't always talk about how we choose the charities and causes we donate to.

I’ve had the privilege of working with some pretty amazing people, some amazingly demanding people, and shall we say, some that were less than amazing?  Anyway, we’re happy now growing moss between our toes here in in the Northwest.  \n\nRight after our move, I plunged into the needlepoint and knitting world and was thrilled with the amazing community of women.

I had been living in Seattle, and had started using methamphetamines. I quickly lost my apartment and ended up living under the I-5 overpass. After a warm summer of “I can do this—being homeless isn’t so bad!” the weather started to change. The famous Seattle rain was coming. In the grey, everyone who had seemed so lively and fun over the summer suddenly turned into weird drug zombies. I had a terrible run in with my supplier that scared me into wanted to move on from the lifestyle I was entrenching myself in. I asked my only support network—street kids—if anyone knew of a place to go that would be away, but didn’t take a bunch of money. There would be no rehab in my future. If I was going to get clean, it was going to be by sheer willpower. I was directed to The Boiler Room as a safe haven, a place where I could have the support to clean up and sober up. It was a drug and alcohol free venue in a town I had never heard of. I had to take a bus, a ferry, and then two more busses to get to Port Townsend, a place I was blindly putting my faith in. I fell asleep on the bus, after telling the bus driver where I was trying to go. He woke me up at the bus stop outside of The Boiler Room, and I collected my belongings, straightened my back, held my head high and marched inside. In the building, it was warm. The windows were fogged and a scruffy looking dude was playing guitar in the corner. The tables were full of bundled folks. There was a free food event happening; Sunday Soup. I had barely made it inside the door before an unknown human was yelling that they’d need another bowl. By the time I made it to the counter, a bowl of veggie soup, a hunk of bread, and a cup of milk were waiting for me. I fumbled through my pockets, expecting to have to pay something. How would I afford it? I had less than $5 in change in my pocket. When I was told that it was on the house, I cried. Crying at someone I didn’t know was one of my greatest fears at that point—showing vulnerability meant that I could be taken advantage of. The girl behind the counter awkwardly patted my hand (human contact!) and sushed me. How could she help, she asked. My entire story came tumbling out… Abusive parents. Poor life choices. Homeless. Drugs. Help? I didn’t know what I needed. She looked at me and nodded her head, once, decisively. Sleep, she proclaimed. It was obvious that before I needed anything else, I needed sleep—finish the soup, go to sleep. A phone call was made, and shortly a long haired, bearded, Carhartt-jacketed man stepped through the door, followed by a… pug. The pug was the deciding factor. I went with the man, a Board Member of this nonprofit coffeehouse and social services hub, and slept on his floor for eighteen hours, waking only for water and pug kisses. When I woke fully, he took me back to The Boiler Room. I had my pack, my sleeping bag, my supplies. I slept on the porch of an abandoned house for my first two weeks in Port Townsend, and started volunteering at The Boiler Room. I found a part time labor job through the job postings board in The Boiler Room, and bought a van. I moved into the van and started supplying it for a cross country trip, which I completed in 2001. I returned to The Boiler Room after, because The Boiler Room had saved me. It saved my life. It provided me a base. A home. A family. I ended up attending school and getting jobs through connections I made in The Boiler Room. I became a Youth Representative to The Boiler Room’s Board of Directors in June of 2004. I continued to work on the Board until I became The Boiler Room’s first Executive Director in May of 2012. Continuing to work with the Boiler Room has given me an opportunity to share my story with others, and to be an example that it is possible to turn your life around. This spring, I married a man, a guitar player, I met in The Boiler Room a long time ago, when we were both so young. I filed for a City Council position the week after the wedding. I give my time, my money, and my heart to The Boiler Room. The Boiler Room saved my life, and I do everything I can to return the favor.\n\nPlease see The Boiler Room here: www.ptbr.org\n",,

How could I have ended up blind, paralyzed and confused in a wheelchair. At one time, I had my dream job as a radio reporter in Chicago. My friends knew me as Zsa Zsa because I turned into a glamorpuss once I started making real money. And now this. I felt like a burden to my family. I was blind, paralyzed and unable to live on my own. \nIt all started on March 22, 2004. I slipped out of my office early at WTVN radio in Columbus, Ohio, to walk my dog Bogie. When I arrived at my apartment, I was struck with a massive headache. It was a piercing headache that felt like my ears were going to pop off. I immediately called my mom in Glen Ellyn. I figured if I was going to die, I would call my mom to say goodbye. I told her about the headache, and she told me to get to an emergency room. I have no memory of the rest of the day. I called 911 and told the operator: “I have the biggest headache on the planet. I need help.” I collapsed on my kitchen floor, stricken with a brain aneurysm. When I arrived at the hospital, Dr. Joseph Shehadi at Columbus’ Grant Medical Center described my condition as “at death’s door.” Before my emergency brain surgery, Dr. Shehadi told me quietly to “be brave.” I underwent a six-hour operation, during which a metal clip was placed on the ruptured brain aneurysm to stop the bleeding. Doctors gave me a 3 percent chance to live. I spent several weeks unconscious, recovering from the surgery. My father sat at my bedside every night while I lay there, reading my favorite children’s stories to me. While I was in a coma, I dreamed I was back in Chicago shopping along Michigan Avenue at the Louis Vuitton store.\n   My co-workers and friends visited me daily, and I was on prayer lists across the country. I woke up three weeks later and learned that Julia Roberts was pregnant with twins, J Lo got married and that I had missed Easter. My recovery was bumpy but everyone knew I was back to my old self when I flipped off a nurse in the hospital. The offensive gesture was a positive sign to my friends and family that I was back to my usual feisty self. After more than a year in physical therapy in Ohio and multiple eye operations, this near death experience forced me to educate myself. I eventually made contact with the Brain Aneurysm Foundation. I realized that its support, educational materials and an awareness campaign for survivors and caregivers would help others recover. I am now 100 percent recovered and am extremely grateful for the extraordinary medical care I received in Columbus and for all of the support from my family, friends and The Brain Aneurysm Foundation. \n\nI am reminded of what former Ohio State University Football Coach Woody Hayes said: “You can never really pay back. You can only pay forward.” I have since moved back to Chicago and began to “pay forward” in Illinois. In April 2009, the Illinois House passed a bill permanently make September Brain Aneurysm Awareness Month in Illinois. The bill was sponsored by State Representative Sandra Pihos. With the partnership of a fellow survivor in Ohio, I was able to help the Ohio General Assembly craft a similar bill. At least half a dozen states are working on awareness legislation. I also have been using my Chicago radio journalism experience and marketing background to promote the dangers of brain aneurysms. \nI have been hesitant to step into the spotlight about my brain aneurysm, not knowing if people will look at me differently. However, I am compelled to use my past illness to encourage survivors and caregivers to never give up and to support the Brain Aneurysm Foundation.\n",,

The next morning she awoke with a headache and within minutes became unresponsive.  After rushing her to WakeMed Raleigh, and then UNC Children’s Hospital, she eventually succumbed to complications brought on by a ruptured brain aneurysm – something we didn’t even know she had.  Ellie was a good kid who loved God, her family, friends and school. Some of her favorite things included superheroes, Minions, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and Pizza. She had a wonderful spirit and a personality that saw people equally. She was for all that was good. Losing Ellie has been a devastating blow to our family.  However, we are determined to bring good from this situation so, hopefully, other families are spared our tragic experience.  \n \nWe have been blessed with an incredible community of friends and family. They have wrapped their arms around us during this difficult time and have supported us, encouraged us and loved us. This has given us time to grieve, care for her younger sisters, Grace and Anna, and begin to move our family forward. \n\nOn October 17 of this year, we hosted the first Ellie Helton Memorial 5K & Fun Run at WakeMed Soccer Park in Cary, NC, to benefit the Brain Aneurysm Foundation. We started with a goal of 150 runners and $10,000. With the support of the local business and medical communities, friends and family near and far, an army of volunteers and special guests that included Congresswoman Renee Ellmers and the Duke Blue Devil, we ended up with more than 500 runners and nearly $44,000 to go toward brain aneurysm awareness, education and The Ellie Helton Chair of Research. All because of a quirky kid with a huge heart who touched many.\n\nWhat made Ellie the person she was? \n \n• Super heroes were her kind of people. They are for all that is good and so was Ellie. She didn't like things that were unfair.\n• Her mind and imagination ran non-stop. She was quirky and unique. She could be argumentative and strong-willed. There were days when those traits were the best things in the world and others where it could drive you crazy. But the crazy days were never intentional; they were just her trying to make her way in the world.\n• Because she was different she never saw that in others and loved unconditionally, even when she didn't receive that in return at times. We know she is now in heaven and being loved unconditionally and is whole and happy in every way imaginable. She is accepted for who she is by all around her.\n• We wore pink at her service, as did many friends, family and even strangers around the country that day to honor Ellie because that was her favorite color and vivid was her style\n• When it became obvious the aneurysm was going to be too much to overcome, her doctor put it so perfectly that the 'essence of Ellie' was no longer with us. When her heart, after so much fighting over the two days, continued to beat longer than expected, the nurse described her as having a 'strong heart,' which also summed her up so well. She fought. She battled. She persevered through a lot in her life and that part of her character really revealed itself to us in the end.\n• She was loved and she loved. She loved her family - especially her sisters Grace and Anna - our dog Sadie, her friends, her church and her school. She loved God and was making plans for her baptism, which is why we had her baptized in the hospital in her final hours. We wanted to honor that last, true wish of hers and send her off to God with it fulfilled.\n• Ellie danced like no one was watching and sang like no one was listening. We hope her legacy is one of encouragement to always be yourself and let that shine through: eat a Reese's cup every now and then, feel like a superhero and wear pink somewhere you wouldn't expect to see it. Thank you for allowing us to share a little bit of her with you today.\n\nDid you know?\n\n• 1 in 50 people has an unruptured brain aneurysm – that equates to 6 million Americans \n• 30,000 ruptures occur each year in the United States\n• A rupture occurs every 18 minutes\n• Ruptures are fatal in 40% of all cases; of those who survive, roughly 66% suffer some permanent neurological deficit\n• Brain aneurysms are more likely to occur between the ages of 35-60 (so Ellie’s was unusual) and women are more likely than men to have one\n\n\nBrain Aneurysm Foundation - http://www.bafound.org/\n  \n",,

During that surgery, a medical professional from her team of doctors was talking very candidly to me, my father, and my two sisters.  He was stressing the importance of us being scanned as they were unsure then of the hereditary value to these.  So, we were all three scanned back then, yes, and come back with nothing to be concerned about but who knew then that we should have continually been retested as not only did I end up having one that started leaking on June 4, 2012 but I had a second one that was bigger then the first one.  No, it hadn't started to leak yet, thank goodness, but did have to be surgically clipped 10 weeks after the first one, August 14, 2012.   I suffered a stroke during the clipping of #2 and several vaso spasms, one so grand that I did go to Heaven and can't wait to go back.  I spent that whole summer in and out of the hospitals between surgeries and therapy sessions.  All I can remember about my thinking process during that time was how in the world did I get two after being told that I was fine back in 1991. ?  I started doing my own on line research and not only stumbled across The Brain Aneurysm Foundation and their efforts but also became increasingly nervous for my children.  Yes, my daughter has already been scanned twice, with no negative concerns, but is with a doctor that knows of the concern and will follow up with her for a new scan every 5 or so years.  I have been God blessed in my recovery and understand that I recovered the way I have so that I can fight this fight for ALL.  There are several issues close to my heart because of all of this, yes, but my recovery from both of these has laid the path for my battles.  I will continue to fight so that ALL know about aneurysms and the wrath they can ensue so that hopefully those that have to experience this in the future will not have the same tortuous path that those of us have already experienced with ours.

But I have chosen to work day in and day out for The Cure Starts Now Foundation, a non-profit dedicated to finding the 'homerun cure' for all cancers by focusing on DIPG - one of the most deadly pediatric brain tumors. \n\nWhen I tell people that I work for a non-profit, I always get questions like, 'Is that a stable job?', 'Do you even make enough money?' Going in I knew that non-profits traditionally paid less than for profit jobs, I mean after all they are in the business of furthering a cause, not lining their pockets. For me, I get more satisfaction than just making a paycheck. I am excited to wake up and go to work, because it is another chance for me to help another child or another family. I had an 'Aha!' moment a few years ago where I knew that this was something bigger than just me, and that I needed to be involved with this cause. \n\nSo why am I inspired to give my time when I could work anywhere else? My boss lost her 6-year-old daughter, Elena, to DIPG. Chances are you are wondering what DIPG is. It stands for diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. In laments terms, it is a brain stem tumor that isn't a solid mass, think of it as a jelly fish with tentacles that basically wraps itself around the nerves in your brain stem cutting off basic vital functions. The saddest part - DIPG typically affects children between the ages of 5-7 with less than 300 diagnosed a year in the world. \n\nI never got to meet Elena, but she and all of the other children and families I have met inspire me to spread awareness about DIPG everywhere I go. Over the last four years that I have worked for The Cure Starts Now I have heard the term DIPG too many times. I could never imagine being a parent and hearing the words 'Your child has cancer,' or 'There's nothing we can do'. \n\nI am inspired by the strength and tenacity of these families to just keep going when they are at the darkest points in their lives. Instead of just crawling under a rock when the last thing you want to do is talk to people, these families put themselves out there because they want to make a difference. They don't want another family to have to go through the heartbreaking experience that they did.\n\nOne particular person that I had the privilege of meeting was Lauren Hill, the 19-year-old college basketball player who battled DIPG that inspired the nation last year. Lauren much like my boss, Lauren knew that what she was doing to advocate awareness and funds for research wouldn't help her in her battle, but it would help the next family, until there were no more next families. \n\nI have never experienced the loss of a close family member or friend due to cancer, which is typically the number one reason a person would get involved with an organization such as The Cure Starts Now. But as I grew closer with the Hill family, I knew that once Lauren passed away it would hit me hard, and it did. I am actually getting teary-eyed typing this. What I took away from Lauren was this, 'I never gave up for a second, even when they told me that I had a terminal diagnosis. I never thought about sitting down and not living life anymore.'\n\nLauren's motto was 'never give up', myself and all of the other people that work tirelessly for The Cure Starts Now institute that in our daily lives. We might not have a fundraiser that does well, we might hear the story of another child who passes away, our researchers might not get the best results on a study they are doing, but do we give up? No. Never. I will keep working everyday until we cure cancer and I can put myself out of a job. I will do it for Elena, Lauren and the children who are yet to come. \n\nThat's my 'why', what's yours?\n\nLearn more about The Cure Starts Now at www.thecurestartsnow.org. ",,

I was a single mom working as a waitress and a bank teller while living with my mother.  At 19 years old I had no clear indication of what my life would be like with a child.  Little did I know he would be the influence for all the best choices I would ever make.  If it were not for my 10lb 23 1/2” handsome baby boy, whom came barreling into this world blue and relentless, my life would have resulted in far less happy and pleasant times.  I joined the Army when he was 3 years old to ensure our lives would have some stability and decrease in chaos.  We didn’t have a home of our own, we were taken care of by my mother.  He did not need for anything and I was so very blessed for that.  He grew into a personality that one would describe as a ham.  He loved making people laugh.  He really loved being able to run and play without restraint.  I ensured he would have all the opportunities to cultivate his numerous interests.  We would finger-paint in the kitchen without rules (newspaper taped everywhere with Tony in a diaper and his hands, feet, and body for the brush).  I involved him with all forms of chores and activities in the house.  When he was 3 we commenced trying to teach him, or should I say allow him, to make Kool aide.  That day was annotated as the Kool aide caper day!  His curiosity was inspiring and everyday was truly a new adventure for both of us.  He attended numerous schools due to our frequent moves from my military service.  Although many would think moving like this would be disruptive, it was quite the contrary for Anthony.  He loved to go new places, meet new people, and get out to enjoy life.  He always had a sense of adventure to him and change was never something he feared.  We settled in Seattle for our last home together from seeking out the children’s hospital as a last hope for a chance. \n\nNEW STATE, NEW HOME, NEW SCHOOL: Upon our return to Louisiana, we were yet again on orders to move to Kansas.  We were excited and curious to see what life would be like back up north again.  We were thankful we would be much closer to family even if they drove us nuts sometimes.  We settled into our new home and Anthony began school once more somewhere new.  He came home the first week with tales of misadventures and all the friends he was quickly making.  He was never one to be shy and was highly regarded by his teachers and classmates.  The class clown with manners was something new many of the faculty had not seen before.  I never had any behavioral issues other than the fact that he HATED homework.  He was smart as a whip but when it came time to sitting still and showing his knowledge on paper, it was a fight to the death!  Patience was definitely something we both learned to rely on together.  A new week began and as I patiently awaited his arrival on the bus I was thinking about what we would be doing this weekend.  I was planning a large Halloween event (it was our favorite holiday, mine more than his).  I saw him coming off the bus with a slight limp.  I asked very quickly “what’s wrong baby”?  He said “nothing mom, my legs just hurt a little”.  A little was one way Anthony showed how truly strong and enduring he was.  He didn’t mention he cried through most of gym class.  He didn’t mention he could barely bend his knees.  He never wanted me to worry about him.  He was always trying to protect my feelings.  Even at the age of 6 years old he cared more about others than himself.  To say he was tough is truly not an accurate description.   The gym teacher had him sit out of class for the day due to his strained attempts at participating in kickball.  I told him to try again tomorrow and I called the nurse to have her call me if anything changes or it gets worse. In my head I was thinking growing pains and a little too much activity.  I was watching him wince and moan at home that evening and assumed he would be ok.   \nBUT, HE NEVER EVEN HAD THE FLU BEFORE…..:The next day he returned home but in a much worse state than the day prior.  He could barely walk.  He was crying on and off.  He looked scared and now I was too.  I immediately called the doctor’s office and the soonest they could see us was the next day.  I was married to my ex-husband at the time and he was going to take him for me.  I wanted to go but unfortunately the saying in the Army is if they wanted you to have a family they would have issued you one (thankfully this statement became irrelevant following his diagnosis).  That evening while I assumed he was soundly asleep, a terrible scream came echoing down our hallways.  It didn’t stop and I fell a few times running to get to him.  I assumed the worse; a break in and someone hurting him.  However; it was not that at all.  He was lying in bed with his face frozen in pain.  He was screaming that his bones hurt and he couldn’t move them.  I tried to console him and hide my fear.  I soothed him with words a warm towel and some Tylenol.  I laid with him that night and prayed that he was going to be okay.  To say the next day went by like a bad dream would be an understatement.  I was in processing my unit while Anthony was at the doctor with his step dad.  I was unaware of what was going on and dutifully watching my phone for any news.  I made it home before they did that day.  I watched my truck pull up with my beautiful son in the passenger seat, eyes red from tears.  My ex-husband ran to the other side of the truck and began helping my son out.  I darted inside to get his overstuffed bean bag to place in the driveway because he could not bear to walk another step.  The look on his face was gut wrenching.  I went into the house and was told the most unbelievable news I could have ever dreamed of.  Something you would only see on a big screen between two seasoned actors.  I was told they had a room at Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City waiting for our arrival.  It was vaguely stated that they may be concerned there was a need to check for blood cancers but most likely he just had a terrible infection and we would be back home in no time.  I felt that this did not make sense.  I felt in my heart and stomach that something was terribly wrong and they did not have the nerve to tell us.  I packed a bag for a couple days in between constantly checking on Anthony and repetitively asking if he was okay.  He kept asking if he was okay and I said they just need to do some tests and he would be just fine.  I felt like I was telling a terrible lie.  I didn’t know I really was.  Anthony had never had the flu, an allergic reaction, or even a broken bone.  He was healthy as developmentally ahead of his peers.  I didn’t feed him fast food.  We ate a full balanced meal every night at the dinner table.  He even loved Brussel sprouts, yogurt, and salad.  I drove with a determination I had never had before.  Even more than while deployed and dodging things that would take my life.  He slept in between us and my tears would not stop flowing.  MORE EARTH SHATTERING NEWS: On the 2nd of October 2009 we arrived at Children’s Mercy.  We did the appropriate paperwork at the first floor admission desk still unaware of what exactly we were being admitted for.  Thankfully I had the foresight to join the military and insurance was not a concern.  I could only imagine how this story would have unfolded if it had not been for the amazing healthcare benefits we received.  We were escorted to the third floor via back hallways.  Tony was in a wheelchair crying once more because of the pain.  I inquired as to where we were going and was informed the 3rd floor.  Upon our arrival I was a bit disoriented by the business of the floor to notice where we were.  We got to our room which I immediately thought was very large and roomy for just doing tests.  There was a whiteboard in front of my face that said: WELCOME ANTHONY to the pediatric cancer floor.  For more information please check out  www.cancer.org  and follow the pediatric link.  I felt the floor give way underneath me.  I looked at Tony as he was being picked up and placed in his new bed, screaming from pain and discomfort.  I held back my fear, anger, confusion, and sadness to assist in getting him some comfort.  I knew at that moment we were no longer soldiers but we now had to wear the survivor hat. The next few days were like a reoccurring nightmare.  Questions, history gathering, more questions.  Meetings with doctors who disclosed he did in fact have AML.  They took us to the bad news room for this.  Many parents who have been in my shoes know exactly what I am speaking of.  They gave us time to ask questions, cry, ask more questions, and yell in distress and confusion.  After gathering myself with my new you have cancer now what binders I began the journey as a mom with a child who has leukemia.  An advocate, vomit cleaner, head shaver, comforter, tear dryer, pillow, stress magnet, and more.  Most of all, I was still his mother.  Lost and mad that I could not do anything to make him better.  No amount of “I love yous” or gifts made any of it any better.  Watching him be poked for blood samples and scream because he had never had his blood “taken” before.  Sitting in the waiting room while he went into surgery for his Hickman line not knowing the amount of detailed work in aftercare it would present.  How horrid it would look to have tubes hanging out of his chest.  The screams he would release while having his dressings changed.  The fear of never knowing what was next.  Dr. Gammis was our oncologist, friend, and most importantly my sounding board.  I told him to never hold anything back and to be honest with even the worst of possibilities.  I wanted to be informed, knowledgeable, and ready for whatever could happen.  He gave me the best and the worst of news without any allusive or ambiguous wording.  He was comforting and devious while interacting with Tony.  He saw the fire in my son and we all decided that the aggressive and tedious chemotherapy regimen was what we needed to do.  The details of the treatment are lengthy and boring you with them would be a distraction from the purpose of this story.  Even though we were told Tony had one of the most aggressive leukemia’s in children and he also carried the FLT3 mutation making his disease even harder to treat, we stated often that he would kick this things but like they had never seen before.  And my friends that is exactly what he did.  Two months and two chemo regimen later, there was no leukemic cells to be found.  We completed a few more rounds and were discharged with a hail and farewell of nurses and doctors all crying tears of joy.  In my head all I could think was this was way too easy and there was no way this was over.   \nPart of living in remission was to return to the hospital once a month and he would have to endure multiple bone marrow aspirations until we reached the 2 year mark of all clear.  They would draw his blood, check his height and weight, take his vitals, and we would wait a few days for the results.  The time passing while waiting became less excruciating as time went on.  With every all clear I felt a little less questionable about the ease of which he beat this awful disease.  It all seemed too easy.  Life went on as we had once before.  He returned to school somewhat of a hero and enjoyed every minute of it.  The only part he truly disliked was losing his hair and the stares he would receive when he wasn’t wearing a hat.\nOut of nowhere:After about six months Tony was back to being himself physically and mentally.  Nobody would have ever been able to tell he was just beaten down with a determined leukemia and deadly chemotherapy.  He joined the tackle football team (with some reassurance from me to his doctors) and lived with the enthusiasm and comic relief I was always used to.  Unfortunately this return to our normal was short lived.  I was recently reunited with my middle school romance and we had moved in together with his son who happened to be the same age as Tony.  They got along like two peas in a pod and at times not so much.  But they both regarded each other as brothers and looked out for one another accordingly.  While eating dinner one evening I noticed a large and swollen scab on the top of Toy’s right arm.  He had on long sleeves and attempted to pull them down quickly.  I began questioning him about the nature of the scab and examining it like I was a doctor.  You see following the AML diagnosis, I went from a somewhat relaxed mother to a full blown hoverer.  Every cough, sneeze, scab, bruise, or complaint I would directly connect to a possible relapse.  I had no idea this was actually going to be reality.  He explained to us that it was a bug bite he kept scratching.  It was swollen and red to about the size of a golf ball.  I could tell it was infected but I figured since his immune system was recovering it was just a little harder for him to heal.  I called his local pediatrician and the next day we went in for our appointment.  Following a very detailed health history and voicing my concerns the doctor swabbed his arm and stated they would proceed to treat as if he had a staph infection.  I asked if she was going to draw his blood but she assured me it was not necessary and he would be okay.  I left that appointment feeling that something was missed.  I didn’t think the effort was placed in understanding his whole health picture.  After a few days of antibiotic and creams, he spiked a 103 fever.  It was after hours and I remembered quite vividly that while he was receiving AML treatment any fever of 101.5 or higher was an immediate ER visit.  I didn’t hesitate to follow that guideline even though he was technically in the clear.  My fiancé reassured me that he was just fighting an infection and the hospital would not be condemning him to a relapse.  We both waited for what felt like hours for the doctor to return with the blood work results.  A heard a knock on the door and when the nurse entered her face said more than her mouth ever could.  I began shaking, trembling really, and sucking in my breath.  I followed her into the hallway where her first words where “I am so sorry”.  I crumpled and she caught me.  She consoled me and asked me if there was anything she could do.  Initially I said not but then I asked her if should could contact Children’s and coordinate our arrival.  She smiled with tears as well and said she would do anything she could.  I went outside to call my significant other and all I could let escape my mouth was “it’s back”.  I still had to face my son and tell him the terrible news once more.  I took a deep breath, walked into his room, and he looked up with tears and said “it’s back again huh mom”.  I grabbed him and allowed him to cry for as long as he needed.  It wasn’t long before he looked up and said “guess I am going to lose my hair again. But, hey at least this time I know what’s coming”.  His bravery was unprecedented.   He knew he would be receiving more chemo as well as a bone marrow transplant.   This was the standard procedure for an AML relapse.  He did not have any biological siblings so we had to rely on the donor registry.  A marrow match was what we were hoping for since they have the best outcomes.  However, Tony was incredibly unique in his genetic makeup and no human donor was close enough for the team to feel comfortable using their marrow for a transplant.  We did however have a match to a chord.  Mothers can donate their umbilical cords for the purpose of extracting the stem cells for cases like my son.  Thankfully we had one that was only one point less than a perfect match!  A transplant was an arduous process that kept us in the hospital for well over 10 months.  Prior to even beginning I had to have difficult discussions surrounding complications with the worst being his death.  This time was different, this time we felt more hope and encouragement for a cure than before.  There was a new drug in clinical trials that Tony was applicable for.  It had been shown to latch onto the FLT3 mutation and kill the copier that produced them.  It sounded like this time, no matter what; this was going to be it!  We were scared but excited at the potential for this drug (Sorafineb) and the transplant to rid us of our nightmare.  We completed the 2 rounds of preparatory chemo to eliminate all living cells from his body.  This treatment was to bring him as close to death but not quite in order to have the new stem cells graft without his body rejecting them as foreign.  The day of the transplant was very anticlimactic.   The most memorable part was the awful smell that we were warned of.  I didn’t know what burnt cream corn smelled like but that day I found out.  \n\nMoving forward once again: Once again Tony surprised everyone but himself.  He knew he would do amazingly well with the chemo and transplant.  He told us it was no big deal all the time.  He would say I was the one making it a big deal.  I thought this is Ludacris!!!!  He is undergoing some of the most life threatening medical procedures and I am wrong for thinking it was big deal.  He was right.  We were released from the hospital 100 or some odd days later.  Awaiting us at home was a portable feeding system &#40;which was about as awful to watch as the BMT’s&#41;, IV’s and fluids, and other various medical supplies that we were now in charge of handling.  \n\nWe worked together as a family to ensure he was getting all his meds and flushes, dressing changes and feeds on time and clean.  We did okay in hindsight.  Following our second 2 year remission mark, we received orders sending us to Colorado. I called Dr. Gammis and his nurse to inform them of the news.  They told me he is doing so very well that they felt he would be well into a long remission and did not fear any chances of another relapse.  Another relapse was now the worst possible situation and fear I lived with daily.  Although Tony went on with his life living and acting as if nothing happened, the truth is if it came back, there was not anything further the doctors could do.  However, I was sure his AML was gone for good this time and was not at all concerned about the move or transferring his care.  We made it to Colorado safely.  We found a great house, got both the boys enrolled in school.  We did have to stop the sorafineb due to complications consisting of severe bleeding inside his intestines.  While he was supposed to be treated with it for many years, the doctors felt that stopping it now almost 3 years after his transplant was ok.  If it wasn’t for the drug, they were sure he would have relapsed already and due to being past 2 years in remission, the drug had seemingly served its purpose.  He was happy to have no further medications to take.  At one point he was up to 10 a day.  He told me to stop worrying so much and let him be a normal kid.  So that it what I did.  \nThe day my heart was ripped from my chest: 22 August 2014; following a mini vacation to Ohio to visit family Tony was admitted to the ER for a high fever that would not break.  Call it intuition or motherly instinct; I knew it was back once more.  I didn’t want to think the worst and wish it into existence but my head and heart already knew.  We were officially diagnosed on 25 August 2014.  I instinctually went into aggressive chemo mode as did Tony.  He did not address the fact that we were told he would die this time.  We discussed chemo and blood counts, possible plans and palliative care.  Death was not spoken of until the first line of chemo defense failed.  It was then I knew I would have to bury my sweet young man.  \nOur finals days:Our care conferences included Tony.  I wanted him to have the autonomy to dictate how his body was treated.  I knew he would die sooner than later and as a young man now he deserved to have a say so in his final months.  The main question was always, what else we can do.  Unfortunately, the same answer was given:  with a second relapse and failed transplant there are no medical interventions that could give your child their chance of disease free living.  So we began chemo maintenance with the intent of extending his time with us.  All we wanted to know is why it has to be like this.  He dictated what he wanted his DNR to encompass.   Explicitly stating that if he stops breathing on his own he does not want life saving measures like tubes to keep him with us.  This was the hardest part to hear and as his mother it took every fiber of my body to comply with his wishes.   He expressed the types of medications and chemo’s he was willing to try.  After all the planning was done, the emotions and fear swelled up.  He would be okay then begin crying uncontrollably, asking me why he had to die, what was death going to be like, what was heaven like.  I sat and answered all these questions and more as stoic as I could be.  I kept my tears and fear from him.  I couldn’t bear to burden his 12 year old heart anymore.  We had a few outings where we could travel around Seattle within an emergency distance.   In palliative care patients are giving more freedom to leave the hospital and begin enjoying what’s left of their lives.  One day we ventured to Pikes Market.  I gave Tony 80 bucks to spend however he wished.  It wasn’t 1 block from the car I witnessed something I came to take for granted with my son.  There was an older gentleman sitting on a bucket leaning against the light pole.  He looked disheveled and distraught.  I had always involved Tony with volunteer opportunities and giving more of himself than taking from this world.  This sweet young boy with fresh 20 dollar bills in hand decided to exude those values once more.  He handed this man a twenty, shook his hand, and gave him a smile.  I kept walking as to not make a big deal and embarrass him.  I asked him what he did like I hadn’t seen it happen and he said I gave him some money because he looked like he needed it more than me.  \nGoodbye came too soon:  A few weeks later we decided to go to our new apartment in Seattle (next door to the hospital) and begin hospice care.  He was distraught at first believing we were giving up on him, but his counts were proving the leukemia was more aggressive than the treatment.  We spent that first night playing video games, monopoly, and eating a home cooked meal.  Then the pain began.  He was on a pain drip that was not touching the incredible burning feeling he was having through his bones.  He would cry, vomit, cry, sip water, and vomit it all up seconds later.  I explained we were doing everything we could and it was ta that moment, for this first time in his 6 year leukemia journey he said “Mom, I am done with chemo, I am done fighting”.  I wept, I became angry, I left the room, and I wanted him to take it back.  I gathered myself and went back in with his evening dose of chemo and meds.  He said “this is the last time I am taking chemo” and “I love you Mom”.  He fell into sleep finally around 1 am.  The next morning I was awakened by my husband frantically trying to rouse me.  He said “there is something wrong with Tony.  He is lying on the ground not talking”.  I fell and ran to his room where I found my son laying against the bed with his sweatpants down after he had attempted to use the bedside commode.  He was staring at me but wasn’t speaking.  I don’t know if he even could.  He had green bile coming from his mouth and dripping down his chest.  He had peed himself as well.  Freaking out is not a great way to describe what I did next.  Pure terror and panic took over.  I called 911 and kept trying to get him to talk to me.  He was completely unresponsive.  I didn’t get to hear him say I love you. I didn’t get to hold him with him holding me back.  I didn’t get to tell him how sorry I was for anything I could ever think of.  I didn’t get to hear him utter another word ever again.   \n12 year olds legacy:Anthony died 3 hours later on the 9th of January 2015 at 952 in the morning.  I laid next to him, touched him, felt his cold skin, and kissed him hundreds of times.  I listened to the background noise of monitors warning us the time was nearing.  There are no words to describe how those moments felt.  I respected his wishes and expressed his desires to the emergency team.  They gave us a quiet room on the cancer floor with one nurse present for privacy so we could watch our son die in peace.  Why him?  Through his life Tony showed great acts of courage, kindness, and forgiveness.  He never complained about his path and always thought he was destined for greatness.  \nThe Leukemia Lymphoma Society became a part if my life after my sons  initial diagnosis. We knew how horrible and devastating our situation was and witnessed it over and over again with each new face that came onto the hospital floor.   We volunteered out times, walked at all the fundraising events , spread awareness, and raised money to help LLS with the fight against blood cancers.  I hoped my son would see a day that cures were more prevalent than remissions.   Although that did not happen I still believe one day is sooner than later for others facing this demon.   After Anthony passed they reached out  and offered to honor my son as a remembered hero for the 2015 Light the Night Walk.  My heart stopped for this was one way he would make the mark he asked me to do in his name.  I was asked if I could speak at recruiting and fundraising events about him and our mission.  Everytime I got on stage I felt the loss once more but, a calm would follow that allowed our story to move mountains and touch the hearts of so many who knew nothing about childhood cancer.  I can't repay the healing the LLS has assisted in helping me achieve but I will always be one of their leading advocates in the war against leukemia and lymphoma.

At first, I didn’t really talk about it to people beside my family and closest friends.  But in August my mom received the (not totally unexpected but still completely unwelcome) news that her cancer didn’t fully respond to the first round of chemo.  That it was still with her, and that she was facing a really tough few months of aggressive treatment with lots of hospital stays and a stem cell transplant down the line.\n\nThis woman is my light.  People gravitate towards her – it’s her smile, her laugh, her open warmth that just can’t be ignored.  She’s dedicated her life to helping impoverished families with young children.  Everyone calls her Mama Linda because she’s been mother to so many – not just me and my sister.  She is a wonder, and even this bad news she handled with bravery and with grace.\n\nI, on the other hand, was a bit of a mess.\n\nThis is something so big, so scary, and so completely outside my control.

So I decided to get involved and form a team in my mom’s honor.\n\nI announced it on Facebook, and within three hours raised a thousand dollars.\n\nYou read that right:  $1,000 in three hours, via a single Facebook post.\n\nWe were floored at the outpouring of love and support – but that turned out to be only the beginning.  My mom has made such a tremendous impact on her community that people from all walks of life rallied to support us in any way they could.  Because my mom works to support families of limited means, honestly not everyone could afford a cash donation.  So instead, those people joined our team to donate their time.\n\nWe fundraised HARD while my mom got her stem cells harvested.  As we sat in the hospital together we hugged;  we laughed;  we cried; we couldn’t believe what was happening.  I upped our goal to $5000 and sent hundreds upon hundreds of thank you notes.\n\nLook, I knew my mom had deeply touched many people’s lives.  Now I know exactly how much she’s meant to them.  In just one month Team Love for Mama Linda raised $8700 for the Vermont chapter of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.  \n\nOn Friday, September 25 my mom’s closest friends joined me in Burlington, VT for the LLS Light The Night Walk:  a beautiful ceremony honoring all our loved ones who have fought their own cancer battles.  It was breathtaking:  each of us, together, weaving through the dusk of the city with a white, red, or yellow lantern as a survivor, a supporter, or in memory of those we’ve lost.   The community came out and cheered us on;  I patched my mom in via video call so she could take part.  I can’t tell you how much this one night – and this whole campaign – meant to all of us.\n\nI’m both humbled and proud of what we accomplished.  But the Vermont LLS chapter has not yet met their goal;  they’re still over $20,000 short of the $90,000 they hope to raise.  Although my friends and family are tapped out, I want to do whatever I can to help the LLS hit their number.  And so I ask for your consideration:  The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society is a wonderful non-profit.  The funds they raise – the funds we all raise together – goes to real scientists doing real research to save real lives, now.  Please give us your vote – your like – your thumbs-up – so we have a shot at contributing $5,000 more to this cause.\n\nMy mom just got her stem cell transplant on Monday.  I’m writing this sitting next to her at the Norris Cotton Cancer Center at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center.  By all accounts she’s doing well and she’ll be going home in another couple of weeks.  The road ahead of her is long, but she’s a spirited fighter.\n\nAnd this is the only way I know how to help her in her fight.\n\nhttp://www.lightthenight.org/uny/ ",,

A long time ago I became a volunteer with a wonderful Organization, called: the 'Sunshine Foundation'. The Organization was founded in 1976 by a then Philadelphia Police Officer, Bill Sample, to answer the dreams of chronically ill, seriously ill, physically challenged and abused children ages 3 – 18 whose families cannot fulfil their requests due to the financial strain that the child's illness may cause. To date Sunshine Foundation has answered over 34,000 dreams nationwide.\nI received a phone call from the 'Sunshine Foundation' requesting that I visit a family in New York, to give them the packet they need, with all the information they need, to fulfill their son's wish to travel to 'Disney World' in Orlando, Florida. I then visited with the family and met a very special young man who was fighting a battle with a terminal illness. They had everything that they need for a 'Dream Come True' to occur in the next few weeks. When I left I truly felt great that we could help this family. About, a week later, I received a call from the Mom, and she advised me that he son had taken a turn for the worse and that they would not be able to go to 'Disney World'. She requested that I come back and pickup the tickets. I was truly heartbroken.                      I traveled back and met with the family and I spent some time getting to know them, better than I had before. I was not at all happy myself.

I met with the family and I presented this special 'baseball' autographed with a special message to this special young man. He was absolutely amazed that his idol wrote to him and he wouldn't let go of the ball. Other members of the family, plus me were in tears of joy. Just two days later, his mom, called me and told me that he had 'passed away', but since he had that special baseball, he was not in pain - he was truly happy.

What astute patrons may have noticed was that he also joined the cello section on the piece prior to his solo.  This is something he likes to do when standard orchestral repertoire is performed and the conductor & orchestra are welcoming to a 'newcomer' who will get only one rehearsal.\n\nMendelssohn's 'Italian Symphony' concluded the first half of the program, so he had the intermission to re-focus for the Dvorak - a concerto he surely had played hundreds of times.  He sat at the back of the VSO cello section in white tie & tails in a futile attempt to be inconspicuous, but his playing blended easily with the cellists in front of him - a very different approach from playing as a soloist at the front of the stage!\n\nAs a bassist in the orchestra, I found myself just a few yards from our illustrious guest!  At the dress rehearsal, I leaned over to let him know about an altered note in the cello and bass parts (a changed accidental).  When that moment arrived in the performance, he glanced over his right shoulder with a quick smile as if to say, 'See, I remembered!'\n\nA few days later, I hiked into the Symphony office with a small check - my pay for a rehearsal and a concert - explaining that anytime they could arrange for me to sit next to Yo-Yo Ma, I would gladly reimburse my pay for that work.\n\nThis episode was a reminder that inspiration is, by its very nature, a shared experience.

The mission of TWS is to provide a natural sanctuary to wild cats in need and inspire change to end the captive wildlife crisis.  \n\nI have had the pleasure of helping with many tasks at the sanctuary, from building enclosures to cleaning to making fire hose hammocks to picking up tiger poop.  Every task I do, I know I am making life better for a big cat whose previous life was most often filled with abuse and neglect.\n\nDuring a particularly heavy snowfall in northern Minnesota, the cats’ enclosures had over three feet of snow in them.  The tigers residing at the sanctuary don’t mind the cold and snow but the lions (there were three at the time) tend to spend more time inside during the winter months.  (Each animal can escape extreme weather in a temperature controlled building.)  \n\nYou can imagine when a tiger walks in new fallen snow they immediately create a path.  Well, the same would be true for a lion, if they would actually walk in the snow.  So, in order to coax the lions outside, we had to go into their large enclosure and shovel paths for them.  (Anytime people are in an outdoor enclosure the cats are safely shut in their indoor enclosure.)\n\nAs I shoveled lots and lots of snow to make the paths, I thought, “I am an average size woman shoveling a path for a 400 lb. lion!”  I affectionately say the lions are big babies in the winter; but I really know that this is due to fact that they are an African species.  Of all the shoveling I have done as a Minnesota native, shoveling snow for lions is the only time I have gotten excited about shoveling.\n\nAfter we finished shoveling the snow, and the lions were let back into their outdoor enclosure, they immediately investigated every inch of their new path.  It was so gratifying to see them happily exploring and romping in the fresh snow.   \n\nIt’s an honor and a pleasure to give back by volunteering at The Wildcat Sanctuary.  It’s hard, gratifying work and I am so grateful this wonderful sanctuary for big cats resides in Minnesota.\n\n",,

I have always had a soft spot in my heart for animals, whether they are domesticated or wild.

The male could not defend the territory from intruders and take care of the eaglets, so they were removed and sent to the Wildlife Center of Virginia to be raised until they could go out on their own.  This center is a working hospital and teaching facility for all wildlife.  They went above and beyond and started webcams for viewers to watch their progress as the eaglets grew.  As time went on, the Wildlife Center of Virginia was able to install more webcams of a variety of mammals and birds.  To watch the progress of the rehabilitation was truly educational, amazing, and exciting.  The care that they provide is exceptional  from performing surgery, treating wounds, to watching them exercise in preparation for release, to actually watching a release.  The Wildlife Center of Virginia conducts open houses for the public on occasion.  During these times, you can tour the facility, maybe even catching a treatment being performed on a patient, and also visit the educational critters in the outside enclosures.

Not only healing critters to return to the wild, not only the teaching of the world on how to care for our environment, not only conservation....but the family we have become through WCV’s moderated discussion and watching critter cams.  How do I convey that 19 special needs kids feel better about themselves and their extreme medical needs by watching the WCV hospital cams...and as a result they cooperate with their own physical exams? Or that 19 kids dip into their pockets to come up with a $1.00 of their meager allowance to give to WCV because they are so moved by what they see and what they learn, that they want to give back?

How do I describe how one very special person finds emotional healing from seeing the important role that the non-releasable ambassadors play in teaching the world, in spite of their disabilities?  And how a person discovers how much they are loved and valued just for who they are.  I think maybe I can best tell why we are so inspired to give back through the words of one of our special WCV followers. Some call her Carrie, others call her Izzy.  Here is her story:\n“I used to believe that the labels that others give us growing up were defining of us for life. It seemed as though there was no way in which to escape them or the stigma they create and that they followed me no matter where I went. You see when people encounter me on any level they are often quick to notice that I walk differently, I shake or twitch without any real warning, and my vision isn’t quite straight or focused. Instantly that starts the conversation of “what is wrong with you” a conversation I’ve had for as long as I can remember. When I tell them I have Cerebral Palsy then a different conversation begins one that often degrades my intellect as they start to connect that label to someone who must have a mental impairment. It’s a frustrating and hurtful cycle that happens all too often and while I used to chalk it up to ignorance or lack of education even that wasn’t enough to push the hurt away.\nMany will tell you of the lifesaving work that the Wildlife Center of Virginia does for wildlife, but I want to be the one that tells you they also shape and change the lives of their donors. For you see those things I used to believe and the pain I used to feel isn’t part of my life anymore. I know what you’re wondering, where does the connection come from? Well allow me to introduce you to the concept of Education Ambassadors twenty-four amazing animals who are all non-releasable with differences that make them unable to be released into the wild. Each of these animals comes with a background story, and the circumstances that lead them to have visual impairments, flight difficulty, beak misalignment etc. Yet no one questions “what is wrong with them” and no one suggests even for a second that they are of less worth or value than their wild counterparts. \nThat is because in my experience what they may lack in one area the ambassadors more than make up for in another. The staff at the wildlife center all recognize this, and you can see it in their handling practices and in the way in which they interact with the ambassadors. The connection created allows the staff to see beyond the difference to the inner light and personality that each ambassador holds, and they are treasured and valued for who they are. The job of these ambassadors is to help promote the centers mission of caring for and about wildlife but I argue they do so much more than that. \nWhen children or adults witness these animals and their differences they are able to see that being different isn’t necessarily a bad thing, or if they themselves have a difference they may as I have come to realize that isn’t what defines you. You are unique and have something to offer to society as a whole if those around you take the time to look beyond what they see. For each ambassador is strong and is capable of inspiring and teaching others in spite of the challenges they face. Moreover if you spend enough time around each of these ambassadors you will start to notice their differences less and less until they are completely overshadowed by all that you have come to love about them.\nTo put it simply I have become an ambassador in my own life, ever inspired because of the staff and education ambassadors at the Wildlife Center of Virginia. No longer am I defined by the stigma or the labels. I have let my inner qualities shine through and my personality take flight. I never would have seen this side of myself I truly believe without this experience. So when asked why I donate, I can say without hesitation I donate so that others who feel just as lost, just as limited as I did can see they have more to offer than others may have them believe and when they let go of those labels life is truly wild. “\n",,

It was one of the most difficult, heart-wrenching, emotional situations either of us has ever dealt with. In the days and weeks following the loss, we felt alone.  All around us the world was continuing on as it always had and yet ours had stopped. We felt disjointed, as though we didn’t know how to live a normal life anymore. We went back to work, back to our daily routines, but we were just going through the motions. Many people around us acted as though nothing had happened. We learned in that time how deafening silence can be.\n\nLosing a child changes a person. It carries a special type of pain that really can’t be described, only understood by those who have been there. In the midst of our grief, we decided we didn’t want anyone else to ever feel alone in the same way we did. And so, in March 2013, Through the Heart was born.\nIn the time since, TTH has continued to grow and establish itself as a key resource for those experiencing a pregnancy loss.\n\nIn November 2013 we launched our Comfort Kit program, which has received an overwhelming response. We’ve shared stories, started discussions, been an outlet for thoughts and emotions, and helped grieving parents from all over the country – and the world – on their journey to healing.\nI’ve learned first-hand how comforting this community can be. After 2 years of dealing with infertility we received the surprising news that I was pregnant. After several times of seeing the baby growing on target and hearing its heartbeat, we went in for what should have been a routine scan just shy of 12 weeks. It was then that we discovered there was no heartbeat. I had miscarried our son.\n\nThe process wasn’t any easier the second time around but one thing had changed – we had a place to turn. We were more knowledgeable and we had others to talk to. I quickly learned that I also felt more comfortable in telling the news to others than I had the first time because I was confident in my experience, not worried about being judged or having a stigma attached to the situation. TTH also gave us a way to stay distracted and help others – in the early days following the miscarriage, we kept busy by assembling Comfort Kits for others suffering a loss. It helped in our healing to be able to make sure others knew they too had a place to go. That is why I give to Through the Heart – because no grieving parent should ever feel alone.\n",,

My family did not receive confirmation of my hearing loss until I was in pre-school. Yes, I was faced with road blocks but that didn’t mean it was the end of the world for me.  I just had to try harder, work harder, and fight harder.  Just because I can’t hear doesn’t mean I am dumb, stupid or deaf.  I’m just “hard of hearing”.  \n\nI was told numerous times by teachers, doctors and others who really didn’t know me that I wouldn’t live a “normal” life.  What is “normal”?  Who gave you permission to tell me what is normal or not normal.  The way I live in the world with my hearing loss is my normal.  My normal maybe different from your normal but it is my normal.  \n\nTie and Doll's mission is 'Mentoring youth to build their self-esteem and empower them to lead courageously, give generously, and enrich themselves culturally so that they can make intelligent choices and be positive influences in their respective communities.'\n\nI wanted to find a way to inspire and encourage the youth in Montgomery, Alabama that anything is possible.  I wanted the youth to know that he or she is not alone in the obstacles they are faced with.  I just knew that I would be the one to teach the youth something but the youth ended up teaching me some important lessons.  \n\nIn 2010, I had an opportunity to speak to a group of 20 young men in grades 6-8.  I was shocked to see that only 3 of them knew how to tie a neck tie.  I assumed it was something that young men learned how to do like tying their shoes.  Majority of them did not own a neck tie.  In addition to this, I found out that I had grown men that I knew that didn't know how to tie a neck tie and had to get someone to tie their neck tie for them.  I was speechless.  Now it makes sense why these young men didn't know how to tie a neck tie because of the lack of male figures or the male figures in their life didn't know how to tie a necktie.\n\nAnybody that own neck ties or purchased neck ties as a gift knows that it can be pricey.  I presented a challenge on social media such as Facebook and Twitter challenging family, friends and strangers to donate new or used neck ties to give to young.  I received overwhelming positive response to my challenge and collected over 100 neckties.\n\nEvery year, Tie and Doll presents a Spring and Fall workshop to teach young men how to dress for success, and make responsible choices that will prepare them for the real world.  I take the donated neck ties collected from the community and give them to the young men that attend the workshops.  For many of them, this is the first time they learn how to tie knots such as four-in-hand knot, trinity knot or Windsor knot.  At the end of the workshop, every young men get to take home the neck tie.  For many of them, it is their first neck tie.  \n\nFor every neck tie that I donate to the young men, I am proud to know that I am giving them something just like someone gave to me.  I pray that when the young men get older, they will look at this moment and be inspired to give back to young men and teach them how to tie a neck tie.  A neck tie is a small piece of clothing but it makes a big statement when someone sees a young man wear their neck tie proudly.  I am proud to give to Tie and Doll because I get a chance to let these young men know that every obstacle or challenge that come their way will make them be more determine and stronger in pursuing their dreams.  \n\nBeing able to share my obstacles with them allows me to show how I turned my obstacles into opportunities that will bring joy to not only me but to those who are impacted by my drive.\n\nThis is why I give unselfishly.  This is why I thank my support team for molding me into who I am today.  This is #MyGivingStory.",,

Let me give you a little back story on myself. I'm a single mother, and sole provider of 2 beautiful children. A 5 year old and a 3 year old who have been forced to grow up too quickly. What do I mean by that? I guess I'm speaking more in the emotional aspect of life. My children have been exposed to hurt, failure, and fathers who were able to just up and leave their responsibilities like over chewed gum. \n\nI work for a non-profit organization located in San Pedro, California called Toberman Neighborhood Center. I have only been employed here a few months, but I can truly say that I feel for the youth we service. Every morning on my way to work I listen to a song called 'Held' by Casting Crowns, to remind me that- what I am going to work for is not for me; it's for these children that everyone way to frequently overlooks, or looks down upon. \n\nThe kids that Toberman service are children whose families are larger than their income, have drug addictions, are victims of violence in the home, or have fallen victim to and or  become witnesses to gang violence. These children have a world of destruction surrounding them at the age of 5. Dreams are typically shattered at this point for them, due to the lack of family involvement, bullying at school, verbal put down, and a constant string of bad days. \n\nWhen I look back to my own situation, it is not that far off. Both of my children's fathers made it absolutely clear that they were not the first priority in life and that whatever else they had going on was what they wanted and left. The only thing that has kept my kids from giving up has been me. Not to say I'm a great mom; because I am far from that. I have bad days and I have my faults, but my kids don't see that. My kids see the support team that I have working behind me and encouraging me to continue to push through. Without a support team like that I don't think I would be able to provide the support my children need emotionally. \n\nThat is what Toberman is to the families they service. Toberman offers counseling to every family; whether it is for drug addiction, violence, gang retaliation, or loss of a loved one Toberman is there to listen to each individual need and help empower a family to mend broken hearts. Toberman has created a safe haven for children to grow emotionally, build confidence, and to strive for their dreams. There are endless success stories from once 'Toberman Kids.' The kids that were once looked down upon and were told they wouldn't amount to anything are now striving to make a difference; (One Toberman kid is now employed at The Boys and Girls Club working with youth and giving back) or have proven that they were worth it (another Toberman Kid owns his own shop in San Pedro called BadFish clothing company, and another is Major General Peter Gravitt, who is a honored 2 star General). \n\nI am proud to be a part of the support system that these children see and that I work for the place where hope was restored for many. \n",,

Turpentine Creek rescues Tigers, Lions, Cougars, Bobcats, Black Bears, a Grizzly and other assorted creatures that come from private homes and facilities that can no longer take care of these beautiful creatures.\n\nMy husband and I were struggling financially, my husband needed a second job. Scott Smith hired him to drive the tour trolley, he has many skills but was grateful to have this job. This blessing of a job helped us make ends that were far from being met, to being met. About 6 months after my husband started working at TCWR they got a call that turned out to be their biggest rescue ever. A woman in Mountainburg, AR had a very large collection of Tigers in very poor conditions and, as we found out later, very poor health. My husband and I went from being grateful for this income, to having hearts sold out to helping these magnificent creatures. In order to rescue all 28 cats, that were eventually transported to TCWR, homes needed to be built for them. My husband took his vacation from his full time job and helped weld homes for them on Rescue Ridge, the new area for these new residents. We saw some very sick animals come to Turpentine Creek and we wished we could help financially but we were barely getting by. I volunteered time in the office while my husband worked but we wanted to do more. Specially for the ones needing extra healthcare.\n\nToday, if one of the animals is sick and they can not be treated on site they need to be anesthsised, transported to the vet (about 40 miles away) kept under anesthsia while being treated and then while being transported back. A very serious situation for the animal, as well as staff. It's always been a dream at Turpentine Creek Wildlife Refuge to build an onsite Vetinary Hospital. Something my husband and I wished we could make happen. Something that seemed totally out of reach but very necessary.\n\nIn April of 2014 my husband and I were blessed with a very big windfall and one of the first things we did was make a very large donation towards building the Vet Hospital at Turpentine Creek Wildlife Refuge. A campaign kicked off and all the money for the building has been raised but what good will the building be with no equipment? So now there is a big need-some $150,000 or so to equip the Vetinary Hospital-I believe about a third has been raised so far. It would be such a blessing to have this project completely funded. Building has begun on the Vetinary Hospital, we feel so blessed to have been able to help build the Hospital, won't you please help fully fund it?

My husband constantly told me that I was worthless, cursed at me, forbid me from spending time with my family, refused to care for our then three year old son, and repeatedly threatened me with physical violence. I made the decision to file for divorce because I did not want my son, Elijah, to grow up thinking that it was okay to be verbally and emotionally abusive to anyone, let alone someone you were supposed to love. \n\nI informed my husband of my intention to leave him. He immediately emptied our join bank account and moved out. Just a short while later, I lost my job. I went from living in a two-income household to living with no income. In no time at all, shut off notices started arriving and we were quickly running out of food and other necessities. I did not have a strong support system since I was not allowed to develop any friendships while I was married. It got to the point that I was grocery shopping out of my mom's pantry in order to feed my toddler.\n\nWith the thought of becoming homeless in the middle of winter in Oregon looming in my mind, I made, what turned out to be, a life changing phone call. I called 211info, a information and referral program funded by the United Way of Lane County, and explained my situation. I was expecting the operator to refuse to help me because I was on the verge of homelessness due to filing for divorce; my soon-to-be ex-husband was quick to point out how horrible of a mother I was for putting our son in this predicament (though he refused to pay child support). Much to my surprise, the operator was very kind and understanding. She put me in contact with an agency that was able to provide Elijah and I with a food box and some household items; Elijah also received a toy from this agency and he has it on his bed to this day (he is now 7).  I was also given the contact information for an agency that paid my utility bill and yet another agency who provided counseling to Elijah and I, free of charge.\n\nI found out later that all of these agencies, as well as 211info, received funding from the United Way of Lane County.  Since acquiring a new job, I have made it my personal mission to give back to the United Way in any way I can.

This organization has been in existence for almost 30 years and in that time has invested around 1.5 million dollars in a small rural county in Maine. Every United Way is individually incorporated and run by a local board of directors. Many people do not realize that their local United Way is a separate entity from the national United Way. United Way of Oxford County has one staff person, their Executive Director. She works tirelessly to reach out into the community and is looking to bring programs that will create lasting change. Oxford County, Maine is a rural county made up of many small towns. In 2010 it was listed as the least healthy county in the state of Maine. Many organizations came together in response to start to work to make Oxford County a healthier county, and a greta place to live, work, and play. United Way of Oxford County has joined in this effort and is putting a lot of resources towards promoting health and wellness. It plays a large role in the Oxford County Wellness Collaborative, an organization made up of community members, businesses, and other nonprofits who are all working together to create a healthier Oxford County. Most recently, the Wellness Collaborative have started to dig deeper by making strategy maps that will incorporate measures and track real outcomes of initiatives created to improve community conditions. United Way of Oxford County has played a big role in this phase. This small nonprofit is also involved in other initiatives such as their Food Pantry Project where they coordinate food drives with local businesses and donate all items to local food pantries. So far in 2015 they have donated around 400 pounds of food through this initiative. This past summer they also ran a Backpack Project. Through donations from local businesses and foundations, United Way of Oxford County was able to stuff around 450 backpacks full of school supplies and donate them to the 5 school districts in the county. They also are planning to bring in some new projects in 2016. One is called the Dolly Parton Imagination Library. This program will mail a book to a child age 0-5 every month. By the time they enter into kindergarten the child will receive 60 books. The literacy rates in Oxford County are shockingly low and this program will be a step in the right direction to have kids get excited about reading and learning. United Way of Oxford County is currently in talks with partners to try to get this program up and running. The other project they are looking to bring to the county is a Diaper Drive. SNAP and WIC benefits do not include the purchase of diapers, which are very costly. The United Way of Oxford County will set up a day where there will be several donation locations and all diapers will be donated to organizations that work closely with families with young children.

The school nurse said it was probably just growing pains. One night, when Jaysa was eight, I was massaging her leg because of more-than-usual pain when I noticed a thick bulge on the bottom of her left foot. An MRI revealed that she had a large venous malformation, a soft tissue mass of misshaped veins that she's had since birth, but didn't grow visible until now. It explained all the aching and limping she'd been doing for years. \n\nThank goodness for the Vascular Birthmarks Foundation (www.birthmark.org). While the local doctors were somewhat puzzled, VBF's network of doctors immediately knew what it was and how to treat it. She's had three surgeries by Dr. Robert Rosen to shrink the veins.  Now, she can run and cheer with only a slight ache. This past March, Jaysa decided to donate her birthday gift money to the VBF in gratitude for all the help and guidance they gave. Little did we know that the giving would not end there.   \n\nLast week, we discovered that Jaysa has three more venous malformations, one in EACH knee and one in her left hand. These small tumors explain why her knees have been hurting since school started. The VBF was there for me again with advice and articles to help explain her condition. \n\nIn appreciation for all the resources the Vascular Birthmarks Foundation has to offer parents like me, I have recently asked to serve on the volunteer board of directors. I'm inspired to give my time and talent so that other kids don't have to hurt.   \n\nWe want parents, pediatricians, and dermatologists to know to contact a VBF expert whenever they encounter a problematic vascular birthmark.

This past summer I helped plan a major event, The Long Trail Century Ride to benefit Vermont Adaptive, marketed Vermont Adaptive’s brand to audiences on a national level, orchestrated a silent auction, trained with the northern volunteers on Lake Champlain, was a guide to participants who were visually impaired, and paddled in a kayak for the first time. I traveled to places I had never been to before in Vermont (and I’m a native!) and met people from all walks of life. When I started the internship, my goal was to gain professional experience in the industry and help people with disabilities experience opportunities to recreate and overcome their own challenges. But during a time of very difficult transitions in my life, Vermont Adaptive has been my anchor and helped me adapt and overcome as well.\n\nMoments of vast mental clarity have a habit of finding us in random ways. I found mine as I sat in the conference room at the Long Trail Brewing Company next to corporate and town leaders of Killington Resort, the Town of Killington, Long Trail Brewing, the Lookout Tavern and Vermont Adaptive, to plan the Long Trail Century Ride. Coming into the conference room, everyone worked together for one common goal- to help provide adaptive sports to people of all abilities and to create an empowered community at the end of it all. Through the experience, I saw commitment of the whole community, brought together through Vermont Adaptive, to make a difference in the lives of people with special needs and disabilities. It is because of these efforts I can see a brighter future for the community and for people with disabilities throughout the state of Vermont.\n \nThis December I will graduate Magna Cum Laude with my degree in hospitality and resort management from Green Mountain College in Killington.

We ran a campaign for a month and each and every day, I was so excited to see us getting closer to our goal – to provide solar lanterns to 160 families.

In two short weeks, we had raised $213.48, which the students were happy to send to the Wildlife Center of Virginia.  However, supporting the Wildlife Center of Virginia didn't end with the Penny War or the school year.  In the fall, with a new class of 5th graders, we choose to adopt one of the animal ambassadors.  During the school year, my students improved their reading, math, and writing through the learning opportunities provided by WCV.  They wrote stories, poetry, solved area/perimeter problems and countless word problems, and improved their expository reading ability, all related to wildlife. There were countless science and social studies lessons as well.  The students were delighted when their shared projects appeared on WCV's website for others to read.  During online classes, with people from WCV, my students in Arizona were able to learn from others, not just 'the teacher'.  The enthusiasm my students display continues my support of this organization and has expanded it to where students have made and donated ornaments which were auctioned off to raise money for WCV.  My students learn about wildlife, how they can be better stewards of the environment/planet, and how they can teach others the lessons they have learned.  I continue to support the Wildlife Center of Virginia as they support me in my journey to teach my students about the 'real world'.\n",,

They come into this world being given wings to fly- yet humans have for the most part taken this away. They are put into small cages, feed a single pelleted morsel with no variance of variety and are given little time for exercise or sunshine. Their cages are not cleaned until they are disgustingly dirty and the only time that is spent with them is when they are wanted to be put “on show”. Then people wonder why they scream, bite, pluck their feathers and mutilate their own bodies.\n \nAs a financial supporter of Wings of Love Bird Haven, Inc. I know that my contributions are helping to give many birds a better life. Not only the birds in their care but others around the world as they continue to educate people on the best care possible for these sentinel beings. \n\nOne specific donation memory for me was in early 2011 when Wings of Love and another local rescue did a seizure of 40 or 50 birds at one time. There were cockatiels, Quaker, Conure, Amazons, Eclectus and Macaws. These birds were being housed inside a small, filthy and totally pitch black building. They were in terrible condition. One pair of Eclectus was found with over 40 eggs in their nestbox. Of course the birds were in such poor health that there was no way the eggs could be fertile but just the thought of one hen laying that many eggs made me cry. \nThe female’s name was Angel. This sweet little girl crawled around on her belly- most likely due to calcium deficiency. An Angel she is. Even though life has dealt her a bad situation she has the sweetest disposition. She was adopted into a new home and to this day is being loved on and pampered by her owners.  She still crawls on her belly... she still has health problems including heart problems. She still has to have medicine every day. Despite it all... she is an Angel. Her owners live in an Assisted Living Community... she is loved and pampered by the entire community.\n\nWhy do I support Wings of Love Bird Haven?\nNot only do the funds allow them to keep their doors opened and able to continue taking in these birds that need their care, it also allows them to continue to educate the public as well as other bird owners on the best diet, proper housing requirements, need for sunshine and exercise and proper vet care; things that literally save the lives of these birds over and over again as new owners learn and follow these better guidelines. Their mission... in a nutshell is TRIPLE R-E. This stands for Rescue-Rehabilitation-Re-home and Education.\n\nWings of Love Bird Haven, Inc. has taken in, rehabilitated and adopted out hundreds of birds over the past 13 years. This coming year, with the help of generous donors they are wanting to do even more. They are currently raising funds to purchase acreage so that even more birds can be helped. As of now birds are being turned away weekly due to lack of space. With my donation, and the donations of like-minded people around the world the Haven will be able to provide more homes and better education for the birds in their care and around the globe.

Teaira was a very smart girl, but had very low self-esteem, had a hard time making friends, and was very unsure about her future. My husband and I discussed the problem and decided that a mentor or a youth program would be helpful to her. We were surprised to find out that most mentoring programs were income contingent, were very expensive, or automatically disqualified our daughter because she didn’t live in a single parent home. I started talking with other mothers and women in my community and realized that they were having the same problem. The non-profit organizations in our area did not support or focus on the needs of middle income families. This inspired me to create an organization that would support everyone in our community based on need and not income.\n\nFast forward to 2012, my inspiration to help children in need led to the formation of Women of Distinction Network. This organization is comprised of 13 ladies, who work together to mentor young girls, empower other women, and assist people in need within our local community.  In 2013, we were able to mentor our first group of young ladies and offer two, $500.00 scholarships.  Since then, we have started offering brand new laptop computers as part of our scholarship program. This strategy allow us to mentor young girls and women for college and meet a need that is based solely on an essay and a desire to attend college. It warms my heart to see a young woman smile, because of our desire to support her college journey and to motivate her. \n\nEvery time that I have the opportunity to mentor a young girl, encourage another woman, or give out a laptop, I am once again inspired by my daughter, Teaira. Her life completely changed when her Youth Pastor became her mentor. Her self-esteem improved and she was excited about attending college and making new friends. I pray that I have the same impact on the girls I mentor and that they become successful women who give back to another woman and their community. I also pray that Women of Distinction Network will continue to make a difference in the lives of individuals in our community through mentoring, motivating and uplifiting. ",,

These moments are often the most special and are one of the reasons giving to World Wide Village is so meaningful to me.  \n     What inspires me to give to World Wide Village?   The answer is simple…the people we serve.  People with real names, real faces and real stories you might have a hard time believing.  People I have come to love.   This short story is just one example of a thousand stories that I could share about why I choose to give to World Wide Village.  \n     It was 2013 when my husband and I first traveled to Haiti to help with medical missions in a rural village.  Our experiences in Haiti were life changing and we committed to leading medical trips twice a year going forward. \nDuring our third trip we had the opportunity to meet Youventa Alseme, one of our sponsored children who was 4-years-old at the time.  After school finished for the day, Youventa walked across the small gravel road to our makeshift clinic just to give us a shy “hello” (actually “Bonswa” in Haitian Creole).  \n     After meeting Youventa, I really wanted to connect with her family to see how we could best support them.  Youventa had a 10-year-old neighbor named Rosalina who offered to walk us to her home.\n     My friend and I set off to meet Youventa’s family with a Haitian translator, Rosalina, Rosalina’s sister named Anchilove, Rosalina’s younger cousin and Youventa.   In Haiti I always wear very sturdy shoes because of the poor walking conditions.  We often walk through sharp gravel, rough “grasses”, occasional broken glass and garbage.  \nAs we were walking I noticed that Rosalina and Youventa were the only two girls with shoes.  Anchilove and Rosalina’s younger cousin were barefoot and carefully stepping on the rough path.  \n     The memories of the next moment will forever be etched on my heart as I watched a girl at the tender age of ten demonstrate so much love and self-sacrifice.  \n\nI remember watching as Anchilove walked barefoot holding onto Rosalina’s hand.  \n\nI remember hearing Anchilove’s soft cry as she stepped on a thorn in the rough path.\n\nI remember watching Rosalina bend down and gently remove the thorn from her sister’s small foot.\n\nI remember watching Rosalina selflessly remove her own shoes and offer them to her younger cousin as she lifted Anchilove onto her back. \n\nI remember watching Rosalina carry Anchilove while she walked barefoot through the thorns.  \n\nThese moments are what inspire me to give to World Wide Village and the work they are doing in Haiti.  Girls like Rosalina deserve the opportunity to receive an education.  Girls like Rosalina deserve medical care in their community.  Girls like Rosalina deserve to live in a community where housing and jobs are available for their parents.   Girls like Rosalina deserve to hear the gospel of Jesus Christ.  This is the mission of World Wide Village and the reason I am inspired to give.   This is #MyGivingStory.  \n",,

These women are provided with leased land for cash-crop production, seed money and technical support while foundation staff, volunteers and partnered schools provide guidance and support. The income from these proceeds pays workers a generous wage and parts of the proceeds are used for giving scholarships to underprivileged girls. Similarly, Yang-Ward Foundation also donates library books to local schools where thousands of students are benefiting from these generous donations.How Did I know About Yang-Ward Foundation?I got to know about Nepal through Yangmali Sahadev Rai (who was working as my student worker in undergraduate college), Founder and President of Yang-Ward Foundation. Being an American who has never been to any Asian countries,  I didn’t know about the situation of single women in Nepal. I got to know that rural Nepal has nearly half a million impoverished single women, many widowed and abandoned during the civil war. These single women and their children become outcasts in their local communities, no longer supported by ex- husband’s families, struggling to survive, and barely able to feed themselves and their children, much less send those children to school. This was something that really touched my heart and I wanted to help.When was the First Time I gave To Yang-Ward Foundation?Yangmali implemented his first project in rural Nepal right after getting his seed funding from the Resolution Project, in partnership with The Clinton Global Initiative. When he came back after spending 2 months implementing the project, I was blown away by their work in that area. Within 9 months, his project was becoming self-sustainable. I was blown away by the transformation of the land before and after his project, and the freshly grown organic vegetables. The hard work and dedication of Yangmali and his team was very clear. I got to know that because of his successful pilot project, people from other parts of the country were requesting him to expand the project. Since he didn’t have money to implement other projects, he ran a online crowd-funding campaign with indiegogo in 2013.  That is my first donation to Yang-Ward Foundation because I believed in his work, someone I could entirely trust with my donation as well as I was convinced how my small donation could transform the lives of single women who are the victims of constant discrimination.Now Yang-Ward Foundation has expanded its projects in different parts of Nepal. From cash-crop production to poultry farming and goat farming projects to help single women who were severely affected by disastrous recent earthquakes in Nepal, the work of the Yang-Ward Foundation is highly commendable. The change in the lives of single women in terms of their economic power is amazing.  They are making 5 times their previous salary, working 5 hours a day 5 days a week, compared to 10 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Now Yang-Ward Foundation is giving away 5 full scholarships to underprivileged girls in rural areas. Because of the change in economic power of these single women, local people’s perceptions about the single women are changing. What This 5000 Prize money would do?A $5,000 prize means one more project for Yang-Ward Foundation in rural Nepal, empowering single women. This project will change the lives of single women.  This project  seeks to turn these outcasts into valued contributors to their communities by achieving three key goals: 1) engaging these women in revenue generating agricultural activities that give them financial independence so they can feed and house themselves and their children, 2) achieving sustainability in which their activities can continue without added external funding, and 3) making significant contributions to improving education in local schools through donating books, scholarships, and equipment to school libraries and computer labs.",,

In November 2011, she was diagnosed with Hepatoblastoma, a rare form of liver cancer.  After a month long battle of surgeries (including a liver transplant), procedures and chemo treatments, Zoey passed away on December 8, 2011 six days shy of her 6 month birthday.  Zoey was a beautiful girl with a big smile and a strong will to fight.  She has inspired so many, those that knew her as well as those who never met her but came to know her story.\nZoey’s legacy lives on through a non-profit organization named in her memory, Zoey’s Angels.  Zoey’s Angels was born from the love and support that Zoey’s family received when she became an angel.  They wanted to offer that same support to others who also lost an infant.  Zoey’s mommy and daddy, Gina and Mike, are my dear friends.  I was honored to be a founding board member of this organization.  Though I have moved from Houston and no longer serve on the board, I continue to give back by helping with Zoey’s Angels’ social media, traveling back to Houston for their events when possible, and securing/making monetary donations.\nSo far Zoey’s Angels has given back to 10 families who have also lost an infant after a lengthy hospital stay with a $5,000 contribution each, a total of $50,000 since its inception.  Zoey’s Angels hopes that this significant financial contribution can help them focus on the grieving and healing process instead of worrying about medical bills, funeral costs, and other related financial burdens that carried over from a lengthy hospital stay.  These families are also given a priceless connection to other families that have fought the same battle – someone to connect with that actually understands what they are experiencing now and along their lifelong journey.  \nwww.zoeysangels.org\n",,

I have been fortunate to have attended one of their eagle releases. It was a very moving experience as the eagle was released in honor of a veteran (as is the case with most of their releases) who had recently passed away.  Many tears were shed that morning. As we watched the eagle begin its journey into the wild. A very dedicated staff travels all over the country educating people about these magnificent creatures. One of their ambassadors is Challenger, a 26 year non-releasable old bald eagle who flies at sporting events, visits schools, and meets with veterans of our armed services. In addition to Challenger, AEF hosts internet cams at the Dollywood theme park which has a 30,000 square foot aviary for non-releasable bald eagles. Their Wings of America show features birds of prey and gives audience members a chance to see and learn about birds they may never have a chance to see in the wild. Viewers who can’t get to Dollywood may watch eagles online through AEF’s live streaming cams. AEF also hosts a cam in FL and will have soon one in Washington, DC where eagles have begun nesting again after many years. Thanks to these wonderful cams, viewers from all over the world, including students in class rooms, can ask questions and learn about eagles.

When I got hired on, I was introduced to We Build People (now called Annual Giving). The information I was given was based on statistics in Effingham's Child Care Program. From that moment on, I was hooked. To give back to the children I would interact with day in and day out was the most amazing feeling I had ever gotten, and it is a feeling that I cannot put into words. Never once had I thought 'oh, man I could really use that money right now' because those children needed it the most. Serving in an underprivileged section of the city, you hear stories every day about a child who was abused, or a child who didn't have a meal that evening. But being able to bring children into the Y for Y programs that their parent(s) wouldn't have been able to afford otherwise has allowed children to get a meal, so they won't go to bed hungry. It allows the children to complete homework assignments and increase their grades in the classroom. It allows children to meet friends, and mentors who can help the child grow as an individual and gain self-esteem they may not have had. To see the smile on the children's faces when they get off the bus in the afternoon can turn any horrible day into a wonderful day. Because at that moment you know, you know that the reason you donate your dollar is so that child could have that smile on his or her face just one more day.

One of my earliest memories is of when I was six years old; my dad scooped me up and danced around our living room, singing in his bright tenor an exuberant rendition of “Master of the House” from Les Miserables.\n\nThis past August, I lost my father to pancreatic cancer. He was 56, in his prime, having a record sales year at work and was a beloved leader in our local community theater and Boy Scout troop. At his diagnosis he had been given three months to live, and he made it a full year—a testament to his faith, determination, and propensity to stay at a party long after most would go home.\n\nTwo weeks after his funeral, I moved out of my childhood home in Pennsylvania to Washington, D.C., a city where I had never lived and only a few friends and family in the area. I left my support network behind and started a new job and life on my own, despite my ongoing emotional turmoil. Then, I discovered the work going on at Arena Stage.\n\nThe plays at Arena struck a chord with me the way other performances hadn’t before. I attended a Q&A with a playwright who remarked that live theater, unlike other forms of entertainment, is about “getting to be with somebody working out something that we are struggling with”. Well, I was certainly struggling, and I found that it didn’t matter whether or not the characters onstage were going through the same things I was. Seeing them face down their challenges connected me to the larger human experiences of trial and triumph. Their stories reminded me that I am not alone.\n\nOne weekend, my mom visited me and I brought her to see the play Erma Bombeck: At Wit’s End. Erma’s quips about marriage and motherhood inspired the deepest, frankest conversation my mom and I have ever had about her life raising my brother and me. While we were dealing with our common loss many miles apart, that performance drew us together and opened up vital lines of communication between us. \n\nArena’s outreach programs are also designed around an understanding of theater’s ability to heal the spirit. In partnership with the Wendt Center for Loss and Healing, Arena creates an annual Voices of Now ensemble, in which youth dealing with the loss of loved ones devise a group performance. The process and the product are prime examples of theater art’s restorative power. \n\nThat is why I support Arena Stage. This organization is the model for using high-quality art to enrich, inspire, and heal us, in the best of times and the worst. As I continue to grieve and heal in the coming months and years, I know that Arena will be here to help me along, and I want to make sure they are able to reach as many people as possible.\n\nwww.arenastage.org\n",,

Many of the things that we, his parents, do for him— put a roof over his head, feed him, make sure he is healthy, think about what schools he should attend— are immediate concerns that we think about every day.

Love is the ultimate pursuit in our lives, along with  the desire to be loved and accepted simply for who we are.  A simple concept, but a true challenge in our complex world today, even for normal relationships.  Imagine being homeless and pregnant and not feeling loved in any of your relationships…experiencing rejection by everyone you know and love because you are pregnant. Devastating emotionally, to say the least, especially when such a time should be filled with joy and more love.  I was introduced to Fontebella in 2011.  Fontebella is our local maternity home, situated in the heartland of America, where homeless women can live while they are pregnant  and after they give birth for up to three months. During which time they are nourished not only physically, but emotionally and spiritually, in a loving, clean and comfortable environment.\n\nAt the time I first heard of Fontebella, I had just finished a spiritual retreat and was at a point in my life, discerning my true purpose. How could I use my God-given gifts to help others, in particular, a maternity shelter?   I was a “mom-tographer”, a mom with a camera, and an eye for creativity. It occurred to me that one of the first things  every new mother wants are photos of their newborns.  I knew then, that through photographs, I could give a new mother who could not otherwise afford to have pictures taken, a moment in time that she could treasure and love forever. So with that, I  approached the founder of Fontebella with my plan to take pictures of and give photographs to the mothers at Fontebella.  I began by educating myself on newborn photography, bought props and backdrops and started photographing and illustrating the connection between mothers and their newborns.\n\nPhotographs are a way to capture a moment in time that can transcend you to that juncture just by gazing at it. Giving birth… it is a miraculous and momentous occasion of rapture, and it is  one of the best examples of unconditional love; the one thing we all seek in our lives. Behind my lens, I am witness to this enchantment,  truly, the purest moments of endearment, the unconditional bond of a mother and child, and I give  this moment in time, to mothers whose relationships are broken and whose hearts yearn to be cherished.   I give… to share love…. inspire more love….. and  so that they may never forget…. they are loved! ",,

That was just one year after surviving two ruptured brain aneurysms and three brain surgeries to fix them. I was just 25 at the time, a newly wed and recent college graduate.  I was substitute teaching while getting my Master's degree. When I woke up that February day in 2005 I had no idea why I was in a hospital.  I didn't know what year it was and I certainly had no idea I wasn't even expected to survive. I would have been in total shock if not for loving friends and family there to support me (as well as amazing nurses and some medication in my IV.) Rehabilitation was exhausting, and at times humiliating as I relearned how to walk without assistance, talk in full sentences and focus long enough to write my name. Surviving, at first felt pretty lonely since all my friends were starting careers and families while I was learning all the basics again.  I had more in common with the elderly than people in their twenties! The Rehabilitation Hospital I was at found me a support group for women with brain injuries.  My mother-in-law sent in my membership application and I began to attend these meetings.  I enjoyed being able to laugh at myself with people who understood where I were coming from. The Brain Injury Association gave me the ability to be a part of something again.  Otherwise, I felt like I was not really a part of the world I now lived it.  I have two “most memorable” giving moments.  I have always been eager to share my story in anyway I can if it means helping others on their journey.  Sometimes giving is not monetary but is the investment of time and the willingness to just be there for other people.  In 2010 I was asked to speak at a seminar during the annual conference.  It was the highlight of my new life! I was able to share about my recovery and some tips on daily planning I had used  from my teaching days! It was probably the first day I felt truly alive and a part of something since my aneurysm.  My most memorable monetary moment was fund-raising for this year's “Walk across the Hudson.” My husband and I have attended both years this walk has taken place.  This year I almost decided not to go since our summer had been so busy and I was just exhausted.  At the last minute I knew I had to go. I signed up on the team of a dear friend and began my fund-raising .  Friends and family who have watched my recovery gave generously to my cause. Our team ended up being in the top three teams for for amount of money raised. While funds are a necessary part of running a non-profit it was the camaraderie that I remember most. Hundreds of survivors, caregivers, family and friends all walked that mile together.  While many of our stories share a common thread for those three hours our journey's all came together. Everyone there understood that sometimes Brain Injuries are “silent” as we become pretty good at “looking normal” despite the many, very real struggles we face every day as our brains rewire!! I even met a fellow brain surgery survivor because of a Facebook group we were a part of.  Even though we were both exhausted when we met at the end of that walk, it didn't matter if we were searching for words or having a hard time walking due to cognitive fatigue because we “get it.” I am thankful for the role The Brain Injury Association has played in my recovery.

Giving your time, seeing others happy and making someone feel special is a wonderful feeling!\n\n     My son was diagnosed with TBI as a result of repeated concussions from sports. The diagnosis hit hard, and changed our lives completely. My son fell into a state of depression. He lost his friends, sports and so much more. School, which was once so easy for him, became very difficult. He came to rely on his resource teacher who supported him as he struggled to keep up with his peers. He became frustrated with the changes, sacrifices and loss in his life and he struggled with his self-image.\n     \n     Michael and I were alone. We had no one in our lives who understood this 'invisible' injury.  For two years,  I fought for my son and my family because TBI affected all of us. I spent my days researching TBI to help me make sense of the changes in my son. I knew I had to stay strong to help Michael and keep my family together. I felt like giving up plenty of times; wanting to give in to the helplessness that I felt, but I knew I couldn't. I fought the schools to keep my son on track to graduate with his peers, to help him get through his days.  I fought with doctors who only saw Michael as a patient while administering the same tests and delivering the same heart breaking news.   I wanted Michael to have someone to talk to that he could relate to, someone who had the same invisible injury.  I desperately needed a parent to talk to who understood how I felt.  We knew we needed support.  Help. Anything. Finally, two years later, we were introduced to Lois Tannenbaum, the BIANYS Board President, our angel. She helped open doorways, gave us the support we needed and helped me to better understand what was happening to my son. Lois helped me make sure all of Michael's needs we're being met and that we were getting the best help possible. Lois introduced me to Tish Czachor and the BIANYS, which has changed our lives.\n\n     The BIANYS has provided Michael with a community that understands his challenges and even better, a community that can cheer him on.

Michael has reached out to accept the support that he needs and is now pursuing his dream of going to college.\n\n     I worked in a law office for 11 years. I never felt like I was truly fulfilling my dreams. After all that has happened to my son, I realize how precious life is and that if I want to be happy, I need to follow my dreams.  For me, that meant quitting my job and volunteering my time with BIANYS.  BIANYS has affected our lives in such a positive way and being a part of it is something that I love, and feel very passionate about. I have recently had the opportunity to care for a stroke patient, someone who's life I hope I have changed.  I am truly blessed to have a supportive husband who stands by my side, and is supporting me to follow my dreams.\n\n      Being a part of the BIANYS, has been an amazing experience for my entire family.

As a child I witnessed him give odd jobs to people on the side of the road just to give them work, not necessarily that he needed the help, and do whatever else he could to help them get back on their feet, so to speak. So I knew I also wanted to help people somehow. I just wasn’t exactly sure how until the disaster of September 11th. I enlisted in the USMC (with my parents’ permission) at the age of 17 while still in high school on Tuesday September 14, 2011. While in Iraq, I also saw similar suffering of the people there, which really prompted me to want to help them somehow. Although I was injured in the Marines, I continue to do my best to help people in other ways.\n\nThere is one notable story that I would like to mention. I am a volunteer for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation where I help with their marketing and event planning. While managing their Instagram account, I stumbled across a photo of a 26-year-old college student from Brentwood, California named Tiffany Rich who has cystic fibrosis and is on the donor list for a pair of lungs. Her number one dream, other than new lungs, was to meet Taylor since she said her music had inspired her not to give up hope. In the photo she was holding up a sign reading that was her one wish. I saw the photo on Thursday, July 30, 2015. I did all in my power to gain attention to her photo, which led to her appearing on the NBC Bay Area News. On August 7, she received a call from Taylor Swift and got to meet her on August 15, at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara. The story was then featured on the cover of Buzfeed on August 18, 2015, which has been seen by millions around the world, as well as in Seventeen, Eonline, and Countryweekly. She is now one of the first spokespersons for Cystic Fibrosis and people continue to post about her story with the hashtag, ‪#‎lungs4tiff, with 766 current posts on Instagram with the tag.",,

This was the day that I said goodbye to my best friend, Andrew.  Now you may be thinking that 'important' is an odd way to describe such a matter, but bear with me. \n\nIn the summer of 2004, right before we were set to start our freshman year of high school, Andrew was diagnosed with cancer. I recall being scared about what might happen and worried about what this meant for Andrew's life during such a pivotal time in adolescence, but it wasn't long before my fears and concerns were alleviated. Don't get me wrong, the next five and a half years had its share of hardships. It would prove to be a roller coaster of events full of remissions, relapses, transplants, and hospitalizations. Through it all, though, Andrew managed to live a normal high school life, never letting cancer define him. It was easy to forget, or even know for that matter, that Andrew was sick.  He was known for many things, but never simply as 'the guy with cancer.'\n\nAs Andrew's best friend, I was labeled as his wingman and partner in crime. I was, admittedly, both of those things, but in my mind Andrew was somebody that I looked up to, even if he was 6 months younger than me. I was constantly in awe how someone could have such profound impacts on others by just being himself. Andrew's love for life was contagious and everyone that came in contact with him was significantly happier, because of it.\n\nAndrew received treatment at several Chicagoland hospitals throughout his five and a half year battle, but his journey began at Advocate Children's Hospital. This hospital, where he received so much bad news and spent some of his sickest days, became his second home and the staff became his family. He was eternally grateful for the care he received at Advocate Children's Hospital.\n\nI think back, often, to that Friday in November and the one moment that consistently stands out in my mind is getting into my car, exhausted, emotionally drained, somewhat relieved that his suffering was over, and thinking, “what now?”\n\nThis question was answered months later when a group of Andrew’s friends and family came together to establish Walk It Out For Andrew. Once an annual 5k community fundraiser, WIOFA grew into a year round operation to raise funds for Advocate Children’s Hospital, specifically the Teen Hematology & Oncology Support Groups in Oak Lawn and Park Ridge, IL. These groups are implemented by the Child Life teams at both Advocate Children’s Hospital locations to help teen patients regain a sense of normalcy in a fun, social, and supportive environment. WIOFA helps these teens forget about cancer for a while and attend fun events such as, Chicago sports games, indoor skydiving, downtown dinners and theatre, and other fun outings, free of charge. I’ve had the privilege to join these groups and when I interact with some of these patients, I see so much of Andrew in them.\n\nBeyond supporting teenage patients currently fighting, Walk It Out For Andrew has helped an entire community come together and honor Andrew in a way that would make him proud. On this day, 6 years ago, my life was forever changed when I lost my best friend, but I find solace knowing that I am emulating his passion every day. Andrew’s life made me realize the kind of person I aspired to be, but his death taught me to go out and became that person. \n\nwww.advocatechildrenshospital.com - www.wiofa.org",,

I'm inspired by many things but first and foremost is the compassion for the animals and the commitment to finding a better life for them.\n\nCSRA does not just take in the young, cute, cuddly, easily adoptable dogs.  Sure there are plenty of those coming in to the rescue but there are also a lot of seniors and dogs with an array of medical issues.  The rescue takes them in, finds them foster homes, vets them, and gets them the medical care they need.  Some of these dogs come in to the rescue and never leave as they may be too old or too sick to be adopted and they become long term fosters.\n\nIn addition to making regular donations to CSRA, I also volunteer as a foster parent and would like to share the story of my most recent foster dog Biscuit.  Biscuit is one of the cute, cuddly Cocker Spaniels who was picked up as a stray and pulled into the rescue from an area shelter.  When he came in he needed to be neutered, had worms, and cataracts in both eyes which left him with very limited vision.  Neutering and worms are easily taken care of but blind dogs are much harder to adopt out.  On top of that, he is one of those dogs that takes a long time to warm up to people making adoption more difficult.  Biscuit is one of the lucky ones because one of our very generous donors stepped up and paid for him to have cataract surgery in both eyes and his vision is restored. \n\nCSRA is an all volunteer organization which means that nobody gets paid a cent for the work they do and all donations go straight to saving more dogs.  The volunteers for this group are an amazingly dedicated group of people who work together to make things happen.  Saving these dogs comes at a cost and adoption fees only cover a portion of the expenses with the rest coming from donations and fundraising events.  \n\nCSRA doesn't only save lives, it makes lives better and that is why I give to them.\n\n",,

Their lives are filled with medications, treatments, hospitalizations and just fighting to stay healthy every day.  My husband is one of these brave people.

This was only possible with the support and work of some amazing family and friends.   It was an unforgettable experience for us all and goes to show that one person, no matter how young, can make a difference and inspire others to do the same.

Five more years of continued suffering; researching and experimenting with medications' side effects, major complications, life threatening situations and numerous hospitalizations nearly cost me my family and sapped my will. I felt isolated, alone, an alien to the world and in deep despair. After yet another hospitalization, desperate to find help for himself, alone, caring for me, my husband found a community of incredible individuals.\n\nOur first meeting was a speaker, so we were unsure about a second meeting. The second meeting the group broke up into small share groups of peers, no professionals, but others who had been there, had similar experiences, feelings, life situations to my own and I was immediately hooked. I joined, became a member of the whole, began giving and getting the support, and internalizing the benefits the group experience offered as an adjunct to my wellness plan. The National Organization's focus that year was 'I to We;' moving from 'Illness to Wellness,' from single to many, from isolation to welcome. I had become fully engrossed in the concept of “I to We.” Or so I thought until one night during the opening session of a meeting.\n\nEach meeting begins with a large group meeting, a portion of which is allotted to brief introductions. Members offer their names and usually their diagnosis and oftentimes something brief about the group and what it means to them. Usually short, sometimes, flippant, on occasion profound my introduction one night caught even me off guard.\n\nI was very recently back to meetings from a hospitalization due to an attempt. While I was in the hospital I had friends, new friends, from the group visit me. During one visit a friend asked, “Why didn’t you call?” My response, “I didn’t know I could.” It was then I realized I had friends. A truly foreign concept to me. I had been offering myself to others for years; a shoulder to cry on, a physical helping hand when I could, giving to charity.  I never expected anything of the sort would be offered in return. But standing there, in front of this woman who had just opened not only a door, but my eyes and my heart, I suddenly felt whole, complete. I hadn’t noticed anything missing, but all the same the acceptance of friendship found a home in me.\n\nSo, as I sat there listening to familiar and new voices offer little pieces of themselves to the whole I began thinking. “Here we sit, all “I,” reaching out to find that connection to “We.”” That I was an “I,” who had reached out to find a connection and had found one. No, not one, but two. My isolation, my singularity, became a part of a whole that works together to bring peers from isolation to a feeling of belonging, that works to bring this companionship to all peers. I was proud of that, content with it. But what caught me off guard that night was this: my isolation had turned over to insulation. Much like the myelin sheath covers and protects the nerve cell allowing the energy to flow correctly, without disruption, the membership offered me that same cover. The peers that literally surrounded me in that room, surrounded my isolation, and insulated me from that desperate loneliness that cut off my energy. My “I” had become “We.” It was my turn to speak. I choked up. All I could whisper was my name. I wanted so desperately to say thank you. I couldn’t then.\n\nMy way of saying thank you, how I gave/give back: I became a facilitator, guiding meetings and I was invited to, and became a member of, the Board and now proudly serve in the position of President. \n\nThat’s what we do, why we are here; we offer peers a safe place to share, that itself being an important part of a wellness program, and the opportunity to become part of the group, where one not only gets the support of many, but in turn, gives support to many, this aspect particularly important to those who come from isolation.\n\nEileen.

I asked her if she was ready to tell her story and willingly, she shared.\n\nThe Power behind the Story\nSerena Cripps is a 39 year old woman who grew up in a upper middle class family, Internationally schooled and well travelled. Her childhood however, was dark. Growing up with an abusive father and a depressed mother didn't leave much room to build self confidence. Serena was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and borderline personality disorder and is on disability insurance. In 2010, she and her sister decided to move to Vancouver in hopes of a better life. What they weren't prepared for was the difficulty in finding work and housing in Vancouver (especially being on disability). They found themselves homeless, living in temporary shelters in the downtown Eastside. Serena ended up on a destructive path of stealing, selling drugs and jail. Her fibromyalgia got worse and they discovered that she had a brain tumor. She was devastated. \n\n“ALL THE SIGNS WERE TELLING ME I COULDN’T MOVE FORWARD” - Serena Cripps\n\nTurning Point Moment\nA case worker at a shelter decided to take a chance on Serena. He guided her towards turning her life around and she found employment. She was referred to Dress for Success Vancouver, was given clothing for her new job and she joined their 18 month Professional Women's Group (PWG), a career development program. \n\nSerena met Lorie Corcuera who became her PWG mentor and took the time to invest in her. Throughout the 18 months, they met and worked on Serena's goals and dreams. After graduating the PWG program in June 2015, Serena established FAITH Wellness, a non profit organization that supports people in transitional housing. Since then, she has provided workshops and support to almost 100 people in transitional housing and continues to do so.\n\nRising to the occasion\nOn November 4th, 2015, Dress for Success Vancouver hosted the Success Luncheon fundraiser and recognized Serena's outstanding leadership and achievement by honouring her with the inaugural Inspiration Award. She shared her story with over 225 guests and came to tears with a standing ovation. Serena's comeback can be attributed to her resilience and the many people who took the time to give back and invest in her potential.\n\n'WE ALL NEED TO SUPPORT EACH OTHER WITH LOVE RATHER THAN FEAR'-  Serena Cripps.\n\nLay of the land\nAccording to IPG Media brands study, 19.3 million Canadians plan to shop on Black Friday or Cyber Monday and are set to generate 10.5 billion spend.

Giving Tuesday (December 1st) is a National Giving day that encourages people to pay it forward and give back to charities. The question remains, will there be enough for the average Canadian to give on Giving Tuesday? \n\nFood for thought\nWhat if we flipped the stats around and encouraged the 19.3 million Canadians to do a random act of kindness, pay it forward or give back? What if we took the 10.5 billion spend and allotted some of those funds to charities in need? Imagine the positive outcomes and the many more Serenas that would come out of the darkness.

In particular, the organization focuses on serving girls who would not otherwise have access to accurate and comprehensive health information, either at school or at home. Presently, Girls Health Ed operates in 5 US cities (Washington, DC; New York, NY; Baltimore, MD; Denver, CO; and Los Angeles, CA), as well as in a remote village outside of Nairobi, Kenya.\n\nMy Girls Health Ed journey began nearly two years ago when I came across the Founder’s LinkedIn profile. As part of her public health studies, Sarah Hillware conducted a study on health education in urban and rural cities in the US, Kenya, and India. Her research revealed common issues that adolescent girls across all of these environments face, including nutrition, physical activity, personal care and hygiene, and reproductive health. Sarah wanted to develop a sustainable platform to teach all of these topics in one setting. Thus was born Girls Health Ed. Unlike other health-related organizations that serve girls and young women, Girls Health Ed does not just focus on one aspect of healthy living. Instead, Girls Health Ed recognizes that true health and wellness comes from an equal emphasis on many aspects. Having experienced my own issues with respect to my mental health, I have become acutely aware of the inextricable link among the many aspects of wellbeing, including physical health, mental health, environmental health, interpersonal heath, and spiritual health. Girls Health Ed’s approach resonated with me. I reached out to Sarah, and within days I was blessed with the opportunity to volunteer my time with this amazing organization.\n\nFor the past two years, I have developed Girls Health Ed’s holistic curriculum and have tailored it such that it is culturally relevant to the audience in question. In June of 2014, I led my first Girls Health Ed workshop on the importance of self-care for future academic and professional success. This experience was a significant one, as it forced me to reflect upon my own work-life balance. It is largely because of that workshop that I presently have what I consider a healthy personal-professional balance. In March of 2015, I created a new version of our program to be given in rural Kenya. Creating the Kenya curriculum was a powerful reminder of the importance of cultural competence in program development. \n\nThe first workshop in Kenya, which reached 530 girls, was so well-received that we received requests for workshops from four other schools in the village. Thus was born the #GoGirlGo campaign. #GoGirlGo took place across Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and in-person events in New York City and Washington, DC between July and November 2015. Donations to #GoGirlGo went toward expanding our programming in the US and in Kenya. In particular, we have been able to provide reusable sanitary napkins to each of the girls who attends our workshops and serve healthy snacks during the workshop, addressing two major needs among our target population.\n\nIn March 2015, I was offered my first full-time paying job. Having personally witnessed the challenges in carrying out nonprofit work due to funding, I was thrilled to finally be able to contribute monetarily to an organization I was so invested in. At the start of #GoGirlGo, it was a matter of only hours before I made my $500 donation. Not only had I made my first-ever personal donation to a 501(c)(3) organization, but I would also directly play a role in spreading the curriculum I had created over the past 2 years to even more girls and young women.\n\nAccording to UNICEF, a country’s economic standing is directly correlated with the health and education of its girls. Knowing that my donation is going to allow Girls Health Ed to expand its reach in addressing these two interconnected is one of the most incredible feelings I have experienced. I am excited to continue helping Girls Health Ed empower girls to become who and what they want, ultimately creating a better world for all.\n\ngirlshealthed.org",,

Each one was returning to assist, some were in college and some graduated.  Some were Em’s Spotlight dance students at one time.  Each instructor was touched enough by Em’s Spotlight to continue coming back in the summer to help with the recital.  \n\nI don’t think any of us will ever know the full impact Em’s Spotlight has had but it undoubtedly brings joy to the children and the families that it touches and instills self-confidence to even the youngest performers.\n\nNow I volunteer my time, sponsor a child with financial donations and do everything I can to spread the news of this outstanding organization. \n\nSo what is your Em’s Spotlight experience?  And how can you share it? I encourage you; no make that challenge each of you reading this to tell 3 people about Em’s Spotlight this week.  Direct them to http://tinyurl.com/pmvjr9l  This video will give them a good idea of what Em’s Spotlight does for the community.  Perhaps it will touch them enough to ask how they can help.

That night I began my foray into the deep magical world of coloring, spending nearly five hours on a two-page spread when I realized that I was having one of the best experiences with mindfulness yet.\n\n#mygivingstory\nOne idea led to another and I started thinking what if I offered coloring workshops for people living with cancer?  Facing Cancer Together was excited about the idea. Through the donations of book publishers, makers of colored pencils and pens I had the supplies we needed and recently we completed our 3rd Coloring for Wellness group and I'm looking to run more in the weeks and months ahead.\n\nFor me its been an exhilirating and meaningful experience to see how a supportive environment and something so simple as a coloring book and markers can be. A young art therapist who moved here from Germany sat in the groups and has volunteered to work with me to offer additional expressive arts therapy groups for the Facing Cancer Together community. \n\nFacing Cancer Together not only needs funds but they also need help with their social awareness campaigns. We know there is no shortage of people facing cancer in our community--but until we have more resources, they are facing it alone.\n\nI want to help change that.\n\nWho Among Us\nI've been lying on my back for the past hour, waiting for the alarm to go off. Looking at the ceiling fan and the early morning light, trying to remember everyone we’ve lost, not wanting to forget anyone. I started counting along the fingers on my left hand, and then the right.\n\nWho went first? Was it Pat? Billie? What year? 2005? 2006? Suddenly their names came to me in no particular order. At first there were a few women whose faces I could see but whose names I still couldn’t conjure. Mostly, I remembered their stories and in some cases the first time they introduced themselves to the Writing for Wellness group, at the Wellness Community of Greater Boston, and later Facing Cancer Together.\n\nIn the beginning, I didn’t connect to the new name of the organization. Facing Cancer Together seemed like a mouthful and didn’t roll off my tongue easily. But then I realized how fitting it is; when it gets right down to it, that’s who we are and what we are doing. People who come together with one purpose and one purpose only—to face cancer together—because the weight is often too heavy for one person to bear alone.\n\nWe come together on Tuesday mornings. Newly diagnosed, in remission, and others like me who have had recurrences, all trying to stay afloat and not let cancer beat us down, and rob our lives of everything. We take turns. Some weeks the voice of strength for others, the ones who offer encouragement—we’ve been there—we can tolerate your pain. Tell us your pain.\n\nWe’ve all been the other, the one awaiting test results, and the one who doesn’t know whether this is the time the odds will change. The one who cannot stop crying, who doesn’t believe she’ll ever stop crying. And then she does. Somehow she does.\n\nWe write in our journals, guided by prompts. In response to a poem. Moved by a poet. Mary Oliver. Rumi. Stanley Kunitz. Jane Kenyon. In response to nature. The natural world. In response to a Buddhist perspective on life. To the words of Pema Chodron. Thich Nhat Hanh. One or two lines, a stanza. To help us find a way to say what is weighing on our hearts. A way to go inward, to the substance. Our fears. Our memories. Our childhoods. Times past. Lives before cancer. Lives after.\n\nI remember their stories. The women who lost a father at a young age. The ones who grew up in Boston. Chicago. The South. The ones who had happy childhoods. Good marriages. Children. Grandchildren. I remember their family dynamics. The ones who were divorced. Whose children didn’t speak to them. The ones who felt forgotten. The ones who worried they had been a burden. I remember the ones whose families went with them to every appointment, every treatment.\n\nI remember the women who felt cared for. Supported. Loved. Who had good partners and friends. Good relationships with their doctors and caregivers. The ones who knew how to ask for help. How to accept help. I remember the ones we had to coach. You deserve help and support. Don’t you deserve it?\n\nI remember Pat and Christine. Jan and Rita. Billie, Jane and Karen. Bette, Dee and now, Laura. I remember them. I remember all of them.\n\nWhether age thirty-five or seventy-five, they were all too young to die. Their children too young to be motherless. Their partners too young to be alone. There was too much life left.\n\nI always think they’ll beat it. I always believe in the clinical trial, the last-hope measures. I always believe their bodies won’t be ravaged by cancer. I always wonder whether they know at some point—this time they won’t survive.\n\nIt’s often said, they died peacefully. They lost their battles with cancer. They said their goodbyes. They were at peace. That it’s us, the survivors, who are left in pain. They’ve been released.\n\nAgain we will bury a member of our group. We will say our goodbyes. Shed our tears. In an unspoken agreement, we will leave their seat empty for a while. In respect. In honor. In memory. And then, someone will sit in the seat again. Nervously, we will shift places.\n\nOne day the door will open and in will walk a new person. We will wonder whether they will come back to the group a second time. Whether they will join our small circle. Will they find what they need here?\n\nI wonder, who among us will survive.\n\n",,

'Not again,' I thought to myself. \n\nMy heart ached for people whom I had never met and for a city and country thousands of miles away. While I will never understood the root of such deep hate, I fear that the regularity of these events - shootings, bombings and stabbings of Jews, Christians, children and others - are slowly desensitizing us all. And what happens then?  What happens when those of us who feel the pain of these events and who struggle to comprehend the barbaric actions of terrorists become numb to it all?  What happens when care and concern for ALL of humankind - regardless of race, creed, sexual orientation, and country of origin or socioeconomic status - fades to black?  For me, the loss of compassion, empathy and love is the loss of humanity. When we lose our humanity we lose it all. \n \nMy guess is that anyone reading this agrees in part with the statements above. If my assumption is accurate, it begs a much more important question. What are WE going to do about it?  The operative word is WE.  Each of us individually has an obligation to act because all of us collectively own our future. We must speak up and we must stand up.  We must act. Hope and prayer will not fix this. Edicts from on high will not fix this. The solution starts with one person standing tall and rejecting all forms of hatred, and bigotry.  It then takes the rest of us to make one simple decision. Are we going to be part of the problem or are we going to be part of the solution? Ironically, when it comes to loving our neighbors as ourselves, we become part of the solution simply by choosing not to be part of the problem. \n \nI am proud to be associated with USC Shoah Foundation – The Institute for Visual History and Education, because we are dedicated to overcoming prejudice, intolerance and bigotry and the pain and suffering it causes.

Emily Silverman's family established 'Em's Spotlight' to offer dance and movement classes to people of all ages who might not otherwise have the means to experience Emily's cherished activity, dancing.  Each summer, dozens of young students enrolled in local programs for disadvantaged youth experience high-quality dance training provided by teachers of all ages and backgrounds.  At the conclusion of the training, students get to perform in a live show celebrating their achievements with their friends and families.  This is a wonderful tradition now in its 14th year and local children and their families look forward to it each year.  My daughter, a 16-year-old dancer, Isa, was involved as a teacher in this amazing program this summer.

The photo illustrated a scene of one Canadian Caucasian man and the faces of three young Balinese boys, all with their rich chocolate skin, spirited eyes, and wide, toothy smiles. \n“What gorgeous smiles,”  I responded on his Facebook page.\n“That’s why I do it,” he repeated. “That’s what inspires me to give.”\n “That is what inspires us to give!” Susan echoed after seeing the photo. It was her partner’s hundredth-millionth build, this time in Indonesia this past month, with Habitat for Humanity and the Global Village. Magnificent.\nOk, so it wasn’t his hundredth-millionth build, but he’s been on many. This time, the necessary rerouting of his flight and the closure of three airports, namely the Ngurah Rai airport on Denpasar, Bali, for its overly gaseous Lombok Island Mount Rinjani  spewing ash and debris 3,500 metres into the air did nothing to dampen his spirits. Rick is a seasoned traveler and he was prepared for the unexpected events that might befall even the best-laid travel plans. In advance of the build, he’d given himself enough leeway to savour some personal travelling; he just hadn’t expected the exploration to solely comprise the interior of the Singapore airport terminal, but so be it. Travel is more fruitful than simply the journey of getting to a final destination. It is often the surprises along the way that weave the richest yarns. For Rick, his strongest memories  were wrapped in the Balinese’s children’s abounding smiles. \nHaving had the privilege of my first Habitat  and Global Village experience, I can see myself moving closer to that hundredth build mark. \nIt truly is all about the smiles.\nMy exposure to this nonprofit organization began with my daughter’s interest in Susan’s affiliation with Habitat and GV. Each year, twice a year, Susan loads up 15 to 20 secondary students and connects them with humanitarian experiences that change their lives forever. The timing for El Salvador was not ideal for my daughter. Instead, my husband, Jeff, accompanied the school group. The experience for Jeff was meaningful, if not exhausting, with the forty plus Celsius temperatures and dehydration issues, but it wasn’t just the work itself that made it so incredible. It wasn’t the digging of trenches or the slugging of cement or the witnessing of the students’ new-found appreciation for their life in Canada. It was all about the smiles.\n“That’s why we do it” became the team mantra. \n“That’s what inspires us to give.”\nThis was Jeff’s first Habitat for Humanity and Global Village experience. \nIt wasn’t just about travelling dirt roads by foot or by bike as a tourist would. It wasn’t about taking pictures and tasting unusual foods and tuning in to unique music and dialects. \nThis trip was different. \nFortunate to have travelled for work and for pleasure, Jeff has experienced the lives of children around the world: heart-filled and heartfelt. What he expected and what he observed were two very dissimilar scenarios.  The Salvadorian children he watched, with their tree-branch hockey sticks and crumpled soda-can pucks, playing what we Canadians would consider street hockey, were the most contented amateur athletes he’d ever seen. Jeff had come prepared, like any true traveler would, to celebrate with a population of avid soccer fans in this Central American culture. Jeff  had loaded up his suitcase with deflated soccer balls and mini-pumps from our namesake store, Canadian Tire (Crappy Tire, it’s lovingly referred to here) to bring these street athletes something they couldn’t afford: a soccer ball. Here, in his suitcase, he had packed a dozen crappy plastic spheres that most Canadian kids have piled up in the family garage as last week’s impulse-cash- register purchase for only a loonie (that’s a dollar in Canuck). Just a worthless plaything that would soon be destroyed by the dog, by the neighbourhood friends, or simply by neglect. \nTo the children of El Salvador, it was a real soccer ball to call their own. \nIt was pure joy. \nIt was the smile-maker.\nThat’s what inspired him to give. \nIt was all about the smiles.\nThere’s a familiar children’s story entitled  The Red Balloon. The story has no words, only pictures, but coloured photographical images. Quite an unusual format for a children’s book. The protagonist is a young boy living in Paris, France who is followed from his school to the streets to the bullies in the hood, by a red balloon that seems to have the same personality as a puppy. This boy has no friends. He’s cast out of school for truancy. He’s pushed out of the family apartment by his mom to get him out of her hair. He’s ridiculed by boys his age for being a loner and a loser. One day, a red balloon follows him home, and everywhere else for that matter. The balloon skips school to be with him. The balloon plays hide and seek to amuse him. The balloon antagonizes the bullies and defends his new friend, like a real friend would. In the end, the balloon suffers for his friend when the bullies begin throwing rocks and stones at this balloon. The searing Mediterranean sun takes its toll on the balloon as well, taking away its last bits of air and finally forcing it onto the ground to die. The French boy grieves, just as anyone would, when his friend dies. Like a true friend, the balloon stays until the end of its life. In spite of it being a worthless sphere filled with worthless air, all the things we take for granted when we don’t understand the value it offers someone else, this story focusses on friendship, camaraderie, and loyalty. In the case of the Salvadorian children and their cheap Canadian soccer balls, it too is all about friendship, camaraderie, and  loyalty; the makings of a special childhood, and all it should be, no matter what part of the world they live in, no matter how much money their single-mother makes or how much disease and sickness has plagued their town. The smiles on those children’s faces cannot be purchased for any amount of money. It’s authentic joy. \nIf only our mixed-up world could bottle that joy, then maybe, just maybe, our hatred and our ignorance would go away, if only for  the time it takes a child to kick a crappy fake FIFA soccer ball into a makeshift net and scream, Bravo!\nMy experience on our Habitat build just last month in Amaranthe, Portugal was nothing less. The children we met on our final day around a bountiful lunch table of cod, kale, and Coca-Cola showed us smiles that touched our hearts for the wee bit of time and energy we spent rebuilding their dilapidated 1822 stone hovel that they would soon call home. The house would belong to a young girl named Beatrice and her mother, Suzanna. For ten years, they have lived with her aunt and her two cousins.  Suzanna was cast out of their grandmother’s home when she became pregnant while unwed. In the Catholic faith, sex before marriage is sinful; being a strongly devout Catholic family as they were, such humiliation is intolerable. Lucilia, her older sister, who was married and who followed the Ten Commandments as a good Catholic girl should, protected Suzanna, even when she herself had a very young family to raise and a husband working in Switzerland to pay their bills. Lucilia told us she really had four children:  her own two girls, her developmentally- challenged sister, Suzanna, and her niece, Beatrice. Life was unfair and had become unbearable. The nonprofit work of  Habitat for Humanity and Global Village was their refuge.  Our Canadian group of nine was privileged to help restore the deceased grandmother’s home for Suzanna and her daughter so they could be independent; so Lucilia could live her own life with her own family. \nLooking back, our week of sledgehammering cement flooring, chiseling old mortar, re-barring and laying a new cement floor and re-mortaring the exterior walls  was worth every bruised thumb, every stretched elbow tendon, and every stiff neck we murmured once our final day arrived. \nBeatrice, who had been at school all week, joined us for lunch on Saturday. It was our goodbye meal with the entire family. A large, Canadian flag, left by a previous Canadian Habitat and Global Village group, had graced the door of the 1950s white refrigerator at the far end of the lunch table. We very much appreciated the warm welcome of our red and white maple leaf in this far-away home. As Beatrice circled our plastic stools and square-tabled lunch oasis, she kissed each of us strangers in her familiar European two-cheek-thank you. She squeezed our gift, the miniature teddy bear in its red and white Canadian attire like any child would and told us she was going to name it Canada. Our collective Canadian eyes welled up for her joy, for her brighter future, for her smile. \nThat is why we did it. \nThat is what inspired us to give.\nIt was all about the smiles.\nMy daughter, Lexi? She, too, had her own Habitat for Humanity opportunity. Her group of humanitarian-seeking peers from her Connexions class at Waterdown District Secondary traveled to Costa Rica for two weeks to assist a small community with such much-needed restorations as the painting of an arena’s very sad grey walls, and the rejuvenating of a neglected community green space with a coloured-tiled mosaic pathway, among other various tasks. Her most memorable moments were captured on her iPhone in settings of immeasurable sunsets, suspicious snacks and, above all else, enormous smiles; theirs and those of the children they met in their billeted accommodations. In spite of her challenging on-line Chemistry course and the daunting task of university selection, Lexi’s smile continued to shine through to final exams and beyond. Her Connexions class was her connection to what was really important in life, and the world around her. \nThat is what inspired her to give. \nThat is what inspired our family to give. \nThat is what inspires me to give.\nIt is all about the joy of living and the joy of giving. \nIt is all about the smiles. \n\nhttp://www.habitat.org/\n",,

It's emotionally draining to see dogs, cats or other animals who have been abused or displaced, not knowing if you are there to be kind or cruel to them, not understanding why they are in this new place or where they are headed. It's physically draining to cleaning for a full work day or longer to give the animals a clean space while they await their new lives, to give them food and water on a consistent schedule, to give them treats and talk calmly with each and every one of them to enrich their days. You will push your body and mind to the limits, but my god, it's the most fulfilling experience you'll ever have to help at a temporary shelter. \n\nYou will never forget the animals you work with--you'll pick your favorites and wonder how they're doing and where they ended up, you'll remember the ones that were the worst off and wonder how people could be so cruel, you'll be immensely thankful that you could be a tiny blip of light on their journey to a better life, and you'll get a rush of strange excitement the next time you get a deployment request. Not because you're glad there's a deployment--quite the opposite. I hope for a day when deployment requests are no longer needed. But to be able to be a part of something bigger for even one animal that is hurting is a chance that is hard to pass up as a volunteer. I feel guilty when I'm unable to deploy and wonder how the animals, staff and volunteers are doing, but I know they're doing a fantastic job wherever they are. \n\nAs an HSUS ART volunteer, you become one voice in a crowd that are standing up against animal cruelty and taking the first step to help those displaced by natural disasters. Someone has to do it. Margaret Mead said, 'Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.' And it is the only thing that ever will. That's what inspires me to give.",,

He was tiny at birth, weak and frail and would fit wrapped 3 times over in this little square.  I swaddled him in it night after night and held him tight until eventually he outgrew it.  When the little square would no longer wrap around him I used it to lie underneath him on the floor when he was playing.  He played on that square so many times over until I realized that he had outgrown it again.  He was big enough to stand and play on his own but he carried the square of fabric with him.  Tucked in at night safe in his crib he would lay with this blanket that he had outgrown months before and it brought me great joy.  The joy came in knowing that a square of fabric could have once held him and now he was holding it.  The square of fabric became worn and tattered but he became big and strong.  He overcame all that he faced and today he runs and plays with other kids just as if he never faced adversity.\n\nMy love for my kids and my compassion for others is why we donate to the Mercy NICU in Springfield MO.  I started a small family based charity called Compassion Driven Creations.  We make homemade blankets, teddy bears, headbands (for the girls) and outfits to give to babies that are in need.  Each month we try to take 10 pkgs to the NICU.  The NICU beds 28 so we hope to get a little bigger to where we can take 30 pkgs a month.  Along with the items I mentioned we enclose diapers and an inspiring story like the 'Square of Fabric'.  We know from our own experience even though mild in comparison to what some face that it can be a very difficult time on the family.     \nWe donate to try and bring a small piece of comfort to those that are dealing with so much. We just want them to know that in the midst of their despair they are not forgotten.  There is someone outside of those walls that cares for them.  A smile that might be brought to someone that is hurting is why I donate and volunteer. ",,

I care more about changing the world.\nIf there are two nonprofits I can give this award to it would be my fraternity and the Communities of Giving legacies Initiative which is under the Community Foundation for Greater Buffalo.

Now we are providing opportunities for low income students to travel to Detroit for stem careers or to the hospital for med field careers. They have been giving access to people, places, and things all throughout the Western New York region. They even sponsored me to take a group of buffalo public school girls to go to General Motors and meet CEOS and Presidents.

And it is through these volunteering experiences that I have many of my fondest memories.   \n\nWhen I was young, my mother, a childcare provider at the time, organised regular volunteering trips in and around the local community for all the children she looked after (usually 12-15 of us).  The earliest memory I have of these trips, is visiting a retirement home, where we would spend time talking to elderly people that spent much of their day alone. I was about six at the time, and I befriended an elderly lady named Ruth. Ruth was blind, but we had the best time chatting to one another and going for long walks. She was always friendly and full of life and was an attentive listener and great storyteller.  As a six year old, having an adult’s undivided attention for thirty minutes to an hour was fantastic! And the fact that I could be Ruth’s eyes on our walks, made me feel valued, despite my young age.  \n\nI really feel that this volunteering experience, along with the countless others that followed, contributed to making me the person I am today.  And the compassion, patience and confidence I developed through volunteering, has aided me well throughout my career. \n\nRealising the value that volunteering brings, not only to the individual, but also to the community, I have now left my corporate job of seven years at Bloomberg LP to start my own Social Enterprise to encourage more people to get involved with volunteering in the local community - VOLO (www.volo.org.uk), is an online platform that brings individuals, companies and charities together through volunteering to create social change. \n\nWe are now organising our first volunteering activity in London to help encourage more people to give back this holiday season. At the event, we will be teaching calligraphy to volunteers, who will then use their new skills to hand-design Christmas Cards that will be delivered to elderly people who are alone this Christmas. We are delighted to be partnering with AgeUK East London (http://www.ageuk.org.uk/eastlondon) for this event, a fantastic charity dedicated to providing support services to people in later life.  \n\nI hope that our cards will bring cheer to the many that are alone this Christmas, but more importantly, that our event will inspire people to start volunteering on a regular basis.  AgeUK works with many people like Ruth that would benefit from a few hours of your time, and I guarantee that you will reap the benefits as well. \n",,

Your gift will return to you in full–pressed down, shaken together to make room for more, running over, and poured into your lap.

So he spent his final weeks/months at home in bed, with only my grandma to take care of him.  He is in heaven now, no longer suffering.

Our Purpose at MES is to provide quality housing, healthcare and services to seniors in an intentionally Christian community, on a firm financial foundation, through effective strategic planning.  I have the opportunity to impact our residents' lives every day - I visit with them, pray for them, share my kiddos with them, and raise money for them.

Vision with action can change the world.” -Joel A. Barker\n\nThe axiom that a “moment can change everything,” is often true. I give to iHi International with my finances, my time and my passion because of a moment, which lead me to found the organization last year.\n\nIn the mid 2000’s, I had that moment. I was doing humanitarian work in the northern part of Belize at a school. I was doing manual labor with the caretaker, a Mayan man named Francisco. He was an unassuming, quiet man, and we often worked in silence – not because of a language barrier, but because he seemed to want to. When we did speak, we stumbled through the Mayan/English communication gap by filling in gestures and facial expressions. We worked together for a week, and we were able to communicate about a few things during the time. He didn’t speak much of his family, and only referenced his wife when he did.\n\nOne day I asked if he had children. He responded only after a long pause that he had one son. After yet another pause, he said softly, “but he is not made in the image of God.” Francisco went on to describe how his son was born with significant physical disabilities and impairments. He explained that in his culture and community this was seen as a curse and he was ostracized from his community and his church. I didn’t know what seed this brief conversation had planted until years later. That seed would ultimately grow to be iHi International. During our brief time together in Belize, I was able to talk with him about God, and how I didn’t believe his son’s disabilities was a curse. God doesn’t make mistakes.\nI left Belize. I returned to day-to-day activities and I didn’t think about the interaction for many years.\n\nI was happy at my full time job. I would say I was successful and comfortable. But I started to feel the tug that I needed to do more internationally for people with disabilities. Ultimately, I left a full time job and took on a part-time position in order to free up time to start a nonprofit.\n\nI began the development of a nonprofit organization to focus on the VIPs, as I like to say, Vulnerable International People. Once I knew a nonprofit would be created, it was clear what the name would be: “In His Image International,” or “iHi International.” Francisco felt his son was not created in the image of God, and I did. We are all created equal – whether you are male or female, live in America or a developing country, have a disability or not – and everyone deserves love and the same opportunities as the person next to them. We now have projects and support involving four countries in Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Caribbean.  \n\nWhy do I give?

Every event we work hard to put on, every parent and child we take the time to talk to and love on, every workshop we run to teach families about healthy eating, it all makes a difference in the lives of these families.

When Max was diagnosed with inoperable brain cancer, his parents, like so many parents in their situation, desperately searched for a solution and cure.  What they found was an entire community of parents and caregivers who were seeking empowerment in a context that is so often disempowering.  MaxLove Project was not just founded by Max’s parents, but by so many families who are seeking more for their children and their lives. MaxLove Project has responded to what families are searching for, by providing whole body wellness resources ranging from Fierce Food cooking classes to anti-cancer kid-friendly starter kits sent right to a patient’s home, to providing free nutrient dense broth for SuperKids that boosts their immune system.  \n\nI give, because I have had the privilege of meeting families of children with a life threatening illness, listening to their needs and concerns, and witnessing MaxLove Project meet these needs with love and encouragement.  I’m inspired by families who, newly diagnosed with a daunting diagnosis, march into MaxLove Project determined to give their child every resource they can.  I’m continually encouraged to give, when I see the very families that MaxLove Project supports, donate their own time and energy into helping MaxLove Project and other children thrive against the odds.

They open up their homes, their wallets, and their hearts; giving each one a chance at living a great life. They provide medical care, comfort, retraining, grooming, support, and a whole heap of love. They help them to heal, teach them to trust again, socialize them, and work hard to find them their “fur-ever” homes.\n\nCPR Fund Rescue (IN & IL) also works hard to educate the public with pet safety tips, recall information, bite prevention, dealing with behavior issues, the myths and misinformation that promote breed discrimination, and many other topics. They volunteer at fundraisers, adoption events, and help other rescues and shelters relocate animals by setting up transportation days and cross-posting pages. \n\nIt would be too difficult to pick one particular “moment” that prompted me to give to this particular nonprofit organization. Knowing some of the volunteers and knowing what they give of themselves day after day after day to rescue as many as they can is enough for me to be confident my donations are benefiting the animals 100%. \n\nNot everyone can foster. Not everyone has the ability to volunteer like they do. But everyone can help somehow. By donating funds. By cross-posting profiles of animals for adoption. By donating supplies. By adopting. By attending adoption events. \n\nReach out to them, to your local rescue groups, or any shelter doing their best to care for so many animals in small, underfunded places and I promise you they will have a long list of ways to help than anyone could choose from. \n\n“Saving one dog will not change the world…But it will change the world for that one dog!”\n\nLook at any of the “before & after” pictures, the freedom ride pictures, the dogs in their newly found homes, and you’ll see how true this motto is and why they do what they do.

Endometriosis is a painful, chronic disease that affects at least 6.3 million women and girls in the U.S., 1 million in Canada, and millions more worldwide. It occurs when tissue like that which lines the uterus (tissue called the endometrium) is found outside the uterus — usually in the abdomen on the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and ligaments that support the uterus; the area between the vagina and rectum; the outer surface of the uterus; and the lining of the pelvic cavity. Other sites for these endometrial growths may include the bladder, bowel, vagina, cervix, vulva, and in abdominal surgical scars. Less commonly they are found in the lung, arm, thigh, and other locations.\n\nWhen I found out that this was a common medical condition, I was appalled.  It was then that I also found out that there is no cure for endometriosis and was approached by another sufferer, about starting a way to spread awareness online.  \n\nI instantly volunteered hundreds of hours to create a website and marketing materials along with promoting online.  I have hosted q&a sessions with world renown endometriosis surgeons to help answer questions many women have about the disease (which are listed on our website as a reference).  \n\nThe pain from endometriosis is crippling.  It is devastating.  It can cause infertility.  It affects friends and family.  It keeps us from having jobs.  We undergo, usually, multiple surgeries just to keep the pain at bay.

I instantly knew, that I needed to watch someone eat these.  So with that, we found two brave souls in Tyler Frankenfield and Steve Ott, who will have 20 minutes to devour these mega sweets.  In honor of their efforts, Redwood will donate $1000 to the Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago.  If you would care to donate to this great cause, Redwood will also match your donations (there will be buckets in the kitchens).'\n\nSeeing as how it was World AIDS Day and I am an active supporter of the AIDS Foundation of Chicago I replied that I would double that challenge and eat both a one pound Snickers bar AND a one pound Reese's PBC if the company would donate $1000 to AFC in honor of world AIDS Day.  The CEO readily agreed and the candy eating challenge was on!\n\nI've done a lot of what I'd like to consider difficult endurance challenges in my life including running a marathon, but let me tell you, NOTHING has been harder than eating the last half pound of that candy.  I was only allowed one cup of water which was gone by the time I had finished the Reese's cup and moved onto the Snickers bar, which made the sweetness of the Snicker's bar absolute torture!  It got to a point where my jaw ached, my stomach ached and it felt like my body was actively rejecting the sugar like it was poison.

I was a Masters Student at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. I took a human rights class, a comprehensive worldview of human rights. I was floored by what I learned: the litany of human rights abuses that had occurred in our world, the multitude that were still occurring, and America’s connection to many of those atrocities. \n\nI became enraged. Why wasn’t I taught any of this growing up? Why did our educational system not have human rights curricula? I decided in that moment to bring human rights to the forefront. So began my giving story. \n\nOur family foundation, The Embrey Family Foundation, partnered with Dr. Rick Halperin, SMU Professor, to form an interdisciplinary Human Rights Program. \n\nThe Program’s popularity skyrocketed. Now almost ten years in, SMU offers both a minor and a major in human rights, with designs on being the first PhD program in the nation. It is a shining star of the University. \n\nNow, as we look at the sustainability of the program, we want to reach out more broadly. Our goal is for the endowment to reflect community, a community that works for equality and the elimination of injustices, a community where true understanding is the narrative. This broadened endowment would support three vital areas.\n\nFirst, the program is training a new generation of human rights leaders through its academic curriculum. One of only seven institutions in the United States to offer a BA degree in this field, SMU offers over a hundred human rights courses in many disciplines. Individual creative expression is strongly emphasized, as all students in Dr. Halperin's introductory course must complete an artistic project on an issue of their choosing. Human rights majors have increased tenfold in the last three years and among the most accomplished students on campus.\n\nSecond, the program provides transformational experiences through global travel. Its trips are open to anyone, whether or not they are affiliated with SMU. In places like Poland, Argentina, Rwanda, and Cambodia, travelers bear witness to human rights violations, interact with survivors and activists, and discover their own passion for improving society.\n\nThird, the program facilitates many outreach and action efforts in the community. It has coordinated with the Dallas Mayor’s Office to fight for racial justice, organized students and workers to protect immigrant rights, and brought media attention to issues of human trafficking and gender violence. This summer, the program will gather together representatives from several hundred organizations in a citywide summit called Human Rights Dallas.\n\nAs these examples demonstrate, the Embrey Human Rights Program helps individuals near and far advance their dreams - dreams of dignity, of justice, of making their lives matter, of never again having to feel desperate and afraid. While I am proud of the program’s achievements, I know there is much more to be done. I warmly invite you to join us in creating a world that reflects the program’s motto:\n\nThere is no such thing as a lesser person.\n\nTo make a donation in support of the Embrey Human Rights Program at SMU, follow the link located on the front page of its website: www.smu.edu/humanrights.\n",,

This world isn't about serving ourselves but rather about serving others. Cowboys for Kids is in its 17th year of supporting Camp Quality and each year 100% of ALL money raised has gone directly to the camp. \n\nCamp Quality is a week long camp for kids with cancer to attend free of charge. This camp allows kids to be 'healthy' kids for one week and do things other kids get to do all summer - swimming, camping, hiking, boating, zip lining, etc. Even more marvelous is that this camp provides all the necessary medical treatments for these kids, including medications and often transporting kids to the local hospital for chemo and other treatments. Did I mention that while these kids are at camp the parents get a week 'break' from giving constant 24 hour a day care? These parents can spend the week focusing on other children, careers, catching up at home, etc while knowing their children are receiving top notch care at a camp of their lifetime. \n\nCowboys for Kids has worked for many years to raise money for campers to attend camp at no cost to the parents. Typically, $30,000 to $50,000 is raised by my small community thru generous donations of those whose hearts have been touched by this organization. Not only do I volunteer raising money for the kids to attend camp, I also attend camp and serve dinner. The excitement in the eyes of these often bald, pale, sick children is enough to make me race back home thinking of new ways to serve. The number of kids continues to grow each year even though a few kids are lost each year to the horrible disease known as cancer. I've witnessed parents return days after losing a child to cancer who had high hopes of attending camp. I've seen the love between campers and grieving families as each kid knows they could be the next to not return. I've witnessed parents take pictures next to pictures of their deceased child only to have one more family photo. Cancer is ugly - both for the patient and family - however, this week of camp brings happiness and joy! \n\nEach year it becomes more difficult to raise the necessary funds to send all the campers to camp! This money would be a huge blessing not only to Cowboys for Kids but even more so for those precious children who look forward to being a kid!

A group of Bismarck Animal Impound volunteers decided to start a rescue that was set to alleviate over crowding and unnecessary euthanizations. In October 2015, they received their nonprofit 501c3 status. \n\nThey have adopted over 15 animals into homes. That number might seem low, but it's a huge achievement for a new rescue that has just been granted their nonprofit status. \n\nEvery volunteer is just that, a volunteer. Everyone has their regular full time job on top of what they contribute to the rescue. The rescue runs on fostering. Meaning, furry friends from the impound are taken into people's homes to essentially become part of their family for a short time before they find a forever home. The rescue also has a group of dedicated souls who bust their rear ends when it comes to this rescue; everything from a board of officers to volunteers that clean kennels. \n\nThe rescue has been there in times of crisis too. For example; a lady was going to shoot her dogs, a man was going to dump his cat in a field and her 4 week old kittens, a homeless family could no longer care for their animals, and an elderly couple surrendered their dogs because they were going into a nursing home. All of these examples were animals that were taken into the care of the rescue before something drastic happened. \n\nVet care has become a huge challenge for this rescue to succeed financially. The average spay and neuter cost is over $200, and that's just for a cat. \n\nWhat do I do that gives back to this rescue? I was one of the five people that dedicated their time and effort to start this rescue.

Prior to this, I only met one other person with the same diagnosis.  I was absolutely terrified because  I was supposed to make informed decisions about his treatment and did not even know where to begin. It is a scary when you need to be an expert about something that you know nothing about.\n\nI began making phone calls trying to find services for my son. Many of my phone calls were never returned and those that were offered services we could not afford. By a stroke of luck, I spoke to someone from a parent organization called Milestones. They offered to give me a complimentary ticket to their annual conference. This conferenced changed the course of both of our lives. I learned about ABA therapy and how it was making real measurable differences in language development, social skills, adaptive skills, and behavior. I even met a provider (Jennifer Might) that was able to start a home program for Colin. We immediately enrolled Coin in a home ABA program. Within two weeks he was able to communicate by pointing. It's been long journey but I'm happy to report that 9 years later, Colin is blossoming.\nI am so grateful that my son inspired me to work in this field.  \n\nIn the years following his diagnosis, I have become a Board Certified Associate Behavior Analyst.

My husband and I, along with our brothers and sister-in-law had spent the weekend tearing up stained carpeting and crumbling particle board and laying down plywood subfloor; the hardwood floor installers would arrive the next week.  I felt such satisfaction in this, and more than a little martyrdom for myself: I had, after all, navigated raising three small children in a perpetual remodel for the past several years and would finally (finally!) have one level of floor, instead of three different elevations.  This was especially important since our youngest son was learning to walk and often tripped on the different steps and transitions at his feet. Israel, I read, far away in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, was learning to walk as well.  He was almost two.  At this, the missed-milestones alert in my maternal brain sounded off – this was rather late for a young person to learn to walk.  As I read more about him, this made more sense - before that day, he rarely had the opportunity to move his legs in that way, was never able to develop his muscles enough, and lacked consistent practice. As it turned out, Israel had never walked before that day, simply, because his mother had never had a safe place to set him down.  \nThe story was posted in Encourage Ethiopia’s monthly newsletter. This group’s mission is to expose the full worth of children, families and communities worldwide through holistic developmental support. Their focus, at this time, is on the care and support of disadvantaged single mothers and their children in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.  In 2014, the founders of this organization moved to Ethiopia and created the mother-child center in Addis Ababa. They worked with the local government to identify and enroll the 15 single mothers in most dire need of assistance. For many of these moms, the center became the first safe place they had ever been able to leave their children. While the center provides food, care, and early childhood education for the children each day, the mothers are paired with job training programs that match their skills, experience, and interests.  Mothers and children receive food, counseling, health care, and assistance planning their future.\nI give to Encourage Ethiopia because working and mothering is hard.  I give because this hard work becomes impossible to do well in the absence of a caring support system.  I give, simply, because every mother needs a safe place to set her child down.\n",,

My story starts with a man named John Vance.\n\nJohn was a 1975 graduate of my high school, Coldwater High (Michigan). He was on the student council, the yearbook staff, and the C-Club. He was also the starting quarterback and was elected Homecoming King. John went on to play baseball at Michigan. But when he felt that his studies in computer science engineering were starting to slip he made the difficult decision to quit playing baseball for Michigan, who would do that these days?\n\nJohn was my grandparents’ only son, my mom and aunt’s only brother, and he was my uncle. I recall how he would carry my older brother and I around under both arms like sacks of potatoes. He used to throw our blankets over the living room rafters to tease us, the same rafters I used to put my niece’s presents just out of her reach this past Christmas. He bought my brother and I our first tennis rackets, encouraging us to take lessons at a very young age.\n\nAlong with my father, John was my hero. Somebody that I aspired to be, on the field/court/diamond/track, in the classroom, and most importantly in the community. The first two always came rather easy for me. I was a decent athlete and did fairly well in school, even being fortunate enough to attend the University of Michigan to follow in his footsteps like he would have wanted. But being a good person in the community didn’t come quite as easy and was never really a priority in my life.\n\nAt the age of 6, I vaguely remember when John was first diagnosed with testicular cancer. But what I certainly do remember was watching my mom and aunt cry on a daily basis, and I remember how sad that made me feel as well. Testicular Cancer has a very high survival rate these days as great medical advances were made in the mid-1980s. Unfortunately John was diagnosed in 1981.\n\nI remember vividly the last time I saw Uncle John. I was 7. Our family had all gotten together for a not-so-usual-this-time Sunday dinner. I unfortunately had a bad cold that day so the decision was made to sort of quarantine me in our van so as to not subject my cold to Uncle John who was at that time bald, weak, and frail from the chemotherapy and radiation. I remember he came over to the van to say hello by placing his hand on the window and I did the same, right on top of his. I did not know at the time that this was also our goodbye. On May 25, 1982 after a year-long battle, including a short remission period, John passed away.\n\nJohn was so revered by his peers and teachers that they created a citizenship award in his name. In the over 100 year history of Coldwater High School there is only one citizenship award given out every year at graduation, the John Vance Award.\n\nJohn would have been proud of my relationship and commitment to Max. Max lost his father to cancer when he \nwas 6. THIS is what makes Walk With Sally so special. The Walk With Sally mentors not only sympathize with their mentees, but they unfortunately can all also empathize with them. They all have a cancer story and they all want to give back to a child impacted by cancer.\n\nhttp://www.walkwithsally.org/\n\nAs I’ve gotten older I realize how much more important it is to be a good person in the community. I swear I felt like I spent half my 20 year high school reunion apologizing to anyone that I may have wronged as a cocky kid like a lot of us tended to be in high school. Giving up numerous Sundays to spend time with Max over the past 7 years just seemed like the right thing to do and I know it would have made my Uncle John proud.\n\nSo why do I give back to Walk With Sally? The real answer is to make my Uncle John proud…..",1,1

We had just walked back to the hotel when we started hearing sirens and watched the chaos unfold on TV, just a few miles away. Going to Boston to meet the Hoyts and finish the marathon had been Paul's dream for many years and they achieved that big milestone that year. So it was a very bittersweet day that kick started my inspiration to help Paul reach even more of his goals.\n\nPaul has cerebral palsy, and Gene pushes him in a racing wheelchair.

She explained that they were tears of happiness as she had never thought that running with someone could have such a positive impact on her, much less the lady she ran with. That was the exact moment I knew.

He spent his high school years and first year of college undergoing countless treatments including chemotherapy, stem cell transplants and bone marrow transplants. Unfortunately, Andrew lost his battle on November 20, 2009 when he was just 19.\n\nMoved by his courage, some of Andrew’s friends and family founded the nonprofit Walk It Out For Andrew, or “WIOFA,” in 2010. Our fundraisers benefit Advocate Children’s Hospital, and our mission is to keep Andrew’s inspiring passion alive by supporting Chicago teens battling cancer and blood diseases. As WIOFA’s Director of PR and Marketing, I’ve watched the organization’s incredible growth from a one-time community 5K walk to a strong force now in its sixth year of fundraising.\n\nIn 2014, WIOFA committed to funding the Teen Hematology & Oncology Support Group at Advocate Children’s Hospital in Oak Lawn, IL. This past year, we doubled our commitment and started funding the support group at Advocate Children’s Hospital’s Park Ridge, IL campus, as well.\n\nThe support groups are for hematology and oncology patients, ages 13-21 and promote normalization, socialization and mutual support. Groups help adolescent patients restore hope, achieve a sense of belonging and regain independence by hosting entirely free outings to Six Flags Great America, Blackhawks games and indoor skydiving.\n\nAt WIOFA, we fund the groups because they are so important to the many teenagers who face huge obstacles every day. Too young to die, but old enough to fully grasp that they very well might—is an incredibly dark and lonely place to be. Yet, like Andrew, they keep themselves going, not only by fighting the physical battle, but also by mustering unmatched mental strength. We’re committed to offering these brave patients as much support as we possibly can and continuously expand our fundraising initiatives. This past October, we broke the $100,000 milestone of fundraising since our inception.\n\nThe day before Andrew passed away, I sat beside him in silence until he cleared his throat and said, “Don’t be scared.” Aside from “goodnight” and “love you,” that was the last thing he ever said to me.\n\nHe might have meant ‘don’t be scared of death’ or ‘don’t be scared of losing me,’ but I like to think he had a bigger idea in mind. He knew I lacked confidence sometimes, so I imagine he meant ‘don’t be scared of the future’—and most importantly, ‘don’t be scared to try.’\n\nI wanted to share #MyGivingStory in the hopes that those who read it will take a little bit of Andrew with them and remember those words.

Five years ago, after TMI Project had just begun, executive director Eva Tenuto heard me speak at an AA meeting. After the meeting was over, she approached me. She said she thought I was a powerful storyteller, and asked if I wanted to take a writing workshop with TMI Project. I'd never done anything like it, but I said yes and my life has changed in ways I never could have imagined. In the workshop, I got to know and trust a group of women for the first time. After years of sexual abuse, drug addiction, prostitution, homelessness and imprisonment, I shared my full story, let go of all the shame I'd been carrying, and was able move into my future with a newfound freedom. \nAll of my experiences on stage have been transformative but last year, when I went with TMI Project to perform my monologue about getting tested positive for HIV while I was in prison, for a group of incarcerated teenage boys, I realized how powerful my story could be—how much impact it could have on others.\nWhen we arrived, I looked around at the boys and thought, “They are just like me.” I, too, was stuck in jails and institutions. Repeatedly, I would dream of the day I would be discharged and walk through those doors. Each time, when they locked the door behind me and I heard that sickening clank, I would say to myself, “This is my last time and I mean it.”\nFinally, after 20 years of going in and out of prison, there was a last time. Getting diagnosed with HIV gave me a will to live, and I finally went into the world with a new outlook on life.\nWhen I told my story at the detention center, the boys listened to my every word. They wanted to know, “Ms. Valerie, how are you so happy when so many bad things have happened to you?” “Aren't you worried people are gonna make fun of you for being HIV positive?” “You don't use drugs anymore? How did you stay away from the street when you got out?” They sat on the edges of their seats waiting for answers – from ME!\nOriginally, I was just going to attend the first class, perform my monologue and then let Eva and Sari teach the rest of the ten-week session. But after having heard my story, the following week the boys said they refused to continue with the workshop if, “Ms. Valerie” wasn't there. And so Eva invited me to co-lead the rest of the sessions with them.\nAt the end of the ten weeks, when all the boys finished writing their pieces, we held a reading. One boy ended his monologue with this: “I'm happy I got to meet Valerie because now I know I'm not alone in the world all by myself… Ms. Valerie has a lot to offer to a lot of people who want to listen and I'm willing to listen. When I look at her I just see a beautiful woman who made something of herself. She made something of me. She made me a stronger man.”\nI was back in a detention center, but this time I was not locked up – I was a role model! Knowing my story has inspired someone else has made all of my struggles worthwhile.\nI am grateful to all of the people who support this work in other ways—people who make it possible for the organization to offer scholarships, and to bring their workshops to boys in detention centers, women in domestic violence shelters, military veterans, cancer survivors, adults living with mental illness, the LBGTQ community and other groups.

In the capacity of Economic Growth Consultant, I was witness to the impressive growth in entrepreneurial spirit taking place in Haiti as a result of EGI-Haiti’s activities. \n\nThrough it’s careful and oftentimes scrutinous selection process, EGI-Haiti has created a culture of high expectations among its entrepreneurs. Holding to this standard, my MBA colleague Kushal Toshniwal and I imparted the basics of financial accounting and problem solving to the entrepreneurs by providing them with tools needed for continued success, while managing to have plenty of fun as a group along the way. Watching the growth and development of the entrepreneurs throughout the course, and mentoring these devoted individuals was the most rewarding aspect to the internship in Haiti, and one of the most cherished memories of my MBA experience.\n\nSince its inception nearly ten years ago, EGI has blossomed to become a beacon of hope to Haitians aspiring for a life of dignity and impact. A micro-investment fund is creating a pathway for EGI-Haiti to invest directly in its entrepreneurs and their plans. New programming at Notre Dame now sends a group of MBA students to Haiti for a consulting engagement with Haitian entrepreneurs as a prelude to coursework in South Bend, which will lead to awarding $5,000 in prize money through an annual business plan competition. \n\nThe energy and momentum building around EGI-Haiti is electric. At the 2014 Irish Impact Conference, EGI-Haiti supported entrepreneur Felder Jean Paul was unable to hold back his emotions presenting on his path from an aspiring entrepreneur with $10 in his pocket to running an expansive sandal-manufacturing facility, which offers employment to dozens of Haitians and is currently exploring ways to export into the global market.

Many in the prime of their lives. \n\n\n 'I look upon the multitudes and have compassion.' \n\nParkinson's disease and similar,  equally debilitating illnesses such as  Lewy Body Dementia, PSP, Huntington's, ALS or Alzheimer's represent an ever growing collection of ' Real people, Real lives, Real Stories.'

Until more effective treatments or, better yet, a cure is found, it will continue to be an ongoing attack of a person from the inside out. Relentless and systematic, PD is slowly claiming the life sustaining function, capabilities, and people we hold most dear.\n\n\nOf the top 10 leading causes of death, did you know Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are the only two with no disease modifying therapies?  For this reason, I unreservedly support the World Parkinson's Coalition and the  forum they have planned, the 4th World Parkinson's Congress, that will be held in Portland, OR next September.\n\nwww.worldpdcoalition.org\n\nwww.wpc2016.org\n\n\nAt the WPC, 3500 delegates from 65 different countries will gather.

At the time of my birth and childhood, there were no laws guaranteeing educational help for children who were deaf and hard-of-hearing throughout our country. When the hearing loss was discovered at age almost-five, I still had acquired no speech, and no language, because I had never heard a word, or seen a sign (sign language) by anyone.\n\nMy parents bought me a large body hearing aid strapped to my chest, and speech/language lessons after school in a nearby city began at my parents' expense. Special education wasn't free, then, if one lived outside a city where there were special services. I spent K-12 learning how to talk and how to have a simple conversation. Days were spent vegetating in the regular education classroom without special support, hearing or understanding very little of what the teachers or other students said. When I learned how to read, reading became my main source of learning.\n\nIn college, which I could attend only because of verbal skills attained from reading, not from hearing, I learned that I was actually a 'deaf' person, an 'oral deaf' person -- that is, one who cannot hear speech without amplification from hearing aids (or cochlear implants, now). I studied Deaf Education because that was the only area which felt comfortable to me.\n\nThere was much rejection in the years following, however -- from Deaf people in the Deaf Culture, because I spoke and wore hearing aids, and from hearing people, because my speech wasn't perfect and I often misunderstood from not hearing perfectly. For years, people underestimated my intelligence based on my speech and my 'deaf demeanor'.\n\nIn spite of these things, I have taught the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing for thirty-seven years, and acquired a master's degree without special helps (notetaking, FM systems, interpreting, tutoring). I did things the hard way without realizing it, because that was the only way I knew how to do anything.\n\nAt age fifty-one, my newly-graduated-from-architecture-school  son learned about hearing dogs and urged me to get one. 'I don't need one of those!' I answered. 'They are for really helpless, poor deaf people!' \n\n'But, Mom!' he gently retorted. 'I've been answering the phone for you since I was TWO!'\n\nA wakeup call of all wakeup calls.\n\nI contacted a training school for hearing dogs and received a dog the next year. Six months later, my husband said, 'Wow, my life is so much easier now that you have the dog to help you with mundane sounds!' We hadn't realized how hard my husband worked to be my husband for 30 years without a hearing dog in the house. He not only listened for and told me of sounds that were happening, but also had to do most of the work. It was easier to do the work himself than to tell me, sometimes. Over time, that takes its toll.\n\nAfter the first hearing dog passed away fourteen years later, I was bereft. He had shown me how to be independent so that I could handle everything myself, not lean on others. There were promises from the training school of the first dog to send another dog soon, but it didn't materialize. In the tenth month of waiting, I contacted International Hearing Dog, Inc. to inquire. \n\nThe response and help from International was astonishing. I received prompt, respectful, and kind help immediately. A successor hearing dog was delivered to me five months later. I wondered how one school could procrastinate or not deliver a dog for so long, but another could deliver one so fast.\n\nWhen my successor dog came with the co-founder of International, Martha Foss, I learned that she had come out of retirement to deliver my dog. She explained many things to me, and I quickly realized how International works and why it is so very deserving of public support. I realized that the first training school had a turnover of trainers and used different methods, causing lack of success and an inability to deliver more dogs to people who need them. No wonder a dog for me was nowhere near ready for delivery from that school.\n\nIt is very difficult to train hearing dogs. Training a dog for soundwork is actually the most difficult of all the services, even more difficult than guide dog work for the Blind, because sounds are reacted to by everyone except the one who can't hear them, they happen 24/7, causing the dog to never be off-duty, and a hearing dog must be both high-energy for alerting to sounds, but subdued and professional in behavior for public access. \n\nInternational is exceptional in that it uses only shelter dogs and it has a high success rate of trained dogs. There is no other school that sends out as many trained dogs as International does, for the size of organization it is. Overhead is deliberately low, and the focus is on training and delivering dogs as fast as possible. \n\nMost of the clients/recipients of International are members of the Deaf Culture, which uses American Sign Language to communicate; ASL is not a written language. Many adults, still today, who use ASL as the main form of communication tend to be undereducated and under- or unemployed. The message that they could give goes unspoken, because this is a written competition, not a signed one. Therefore, many of the very people who are served for free by International and are so grateful for it cannot respond to this competition on International's behalf.\n\nI, on the other hand, can speak for all the recipients, and I do so with gratitude and awe of the organization. International could be like other training schools who look for people who can give money, or can give speeches during galas, or can travel at their own expense to appear at events. But International gives dogs to the neediest in our population, those who can speak for themselves the least. I have great respect and admiration for International for helping the most vulnerable and neediest among us rather than targeting those who can benefit the school with money, fame, or other form of prestige.\n\nGandhi, or Mother Teresa, among others, come to mind.\n\nTherefore, International Hearing Dog, Inc. is a main charity of giving for me. The integrity, professionalism, and consistent superior work of International since 1979 deserves to win an award.",1,1

One boy proudly exclaimed, 'I love H.E.A.R.T.!”  Over the course of the four weeks I spent with the good-natured, fun-loving children, I discovered why.\n H.E.A.R.T. (Health, Education, and Responsible Tools) is a summer camp for children from under-resourced communities organized by the Convent of the Sacred Heart.  It offers educational and enjoyable classes to children who might not otherwise have this opportunity.  Courses include public speaking, grammar and creative writing, art, computer science, nutrition, team sports, and swimming, among others.  I taught a class in which the campers learned computer skills, created projects using computers, and published them using Blogger.  Some children didn't know how to open the Internet on the first day.  However, all of them were intelligent, motivated, and apt learners.  Many of them would continue working after the class period ended because they were so engrossed in their projects.  By the end of camp, they were able to make creative drawings online, PowerPoint slides, and creative blog posts.  Teaching technology skills to these children is important because computers are being used increasingly throughout the world, but not everyone readily has access to them.\nWhat makes H.E.A.R.T. such a unique program is that it does far more than what is necessary in order to provide for children's needs.  The campers didn't just learn creative writing skills; they were encouraged to borrow books from a class library during camp and were given free books on the last day of camp.  The campers didn't just learn skills in the classroom; they went on field trips to the Science Barge, where they visited an environmentally-friendly urban farm, and El Museo del Barrio, where they were immersed in Latino art.  The campers didn't just learn what a healthy meal consists of; they received a cooking lesson from a chef on how to prepare healthy meals.  They were also provided a healthy breakfast and lunch each day and brought the leftovers home to their families.  Campers were overjoyed to receive copious amounts of healthy food, and one day I heard a child exclaim, 'This is the best meal I've ever had in my life!'  \nOne of the most important lessons that my experience at H.E.A.R.T. taught me is that the best way to teach children is to instill in them a love for what they are being taught.  Through its warm, relaxed, and supportive atmosphere, H.E.A.R.T. accomplishes this.  The children are eager to learn and apply their energetic spirit to their classes.  They discover what they love and are encouraged to pursue their talents and passions.  One girl who participated in the public speaking class discovered that she truly enjoys to write.  I had the pleasure of reading the beginning of the first story she wrote, which was while the camp was in session.  Her work seemed to be a budding story of suspense and adventure!\n The last day of camp was difficult for both campers and counselors because we had formed such a strong bond while the camp was in session, and we all knew that we wouldn't be seeing each other for an entire year!  Campers brought gifts for the counselors and made us cards.  All of us knew that we would miss the welcoming environment in which children develop not only skills but also a love for learning these skills.  By the time the program ended, I clearly understood why that boy answered 'H.E.A.R.T.!' when asked what he loves on the first day.",3,2

Daughters for life foundation freed me from the ropes that were tied around my arms and ankles and were moving me like a puppet without my will. The foundation made me believe that I have to give not because I need to give; but because the world needs me to and the world counts on me.  The foundation taught me not to wait for a change but to be the change as Mahatma Gundi said: “Be the change you wish to see in the world”.  And yes, the world needs me as I am: a female.  The world needs my Femininity. It is not my gender that determines whether I am capable or not; it is my personality. Never was power of change bound to physical strength. It is ever dependent on the power of personality. Shakespeare said:”I say there is no darkness but ignorance.” \nBy providing opportunities to a vast number of women in the Middle East to pursue their education, Daughters for Life foundation keeps radiating rays of light to eliminate the darkness that shades lives of women in the Middle East. \nThere is a saying by Shirley Chisholm, an American educator and politician that I find pioneering, “Tremendous amounts of talent are lost to our society just because that talent wears a skirt”. It is sad to know that this saying still applies to some societies till now. However, with the opportunity Daughters for Life foundation has offered me I am positive I’ll offer something to the world wearing my black skirt and matching heels. The discrimination women are subjected to in the Middle East is staggering. Males are favored over females to complete their education because a woman is thought to be a house wife so why bother and continue educating her? Even if the woman had the chance to continue her education and work in a decent job, her salary wouldn’t be as high as her male colleagues even if she is as good as them and even better. I don’t eliminate the essential role of women in building a family. In fact, because I believe in the importance of family, I believe in the education of women. “If you educate a man you educate an individual, but if you educate a woman you educate a nation” the Ghanaian scholar Dr. James Emmanuel Kwegyir-Aggrey said. I am confident when I say that Daughters for life foundation is offering a hand in educating nations. \nThis is not all. It requires a solid and firm will to bounce back from a deep fall. It requires fortitude to believe in life after it abducts the breaths of precious parts that complete your entity. The founder of the foundation chose to give even when burning bombs took away the lives of his three daughters. What a great example he is. Another quote by Shirley: “You don't make progress by standing on the sidelines, whimpering and complaining. You make progress by implementing ideas.” Doctor Abuelaish had the right to sob and mourn the lives of his daughters and blame the world for his loss. He didn’t. Instead, he chose to embrace reality and make his loss, a gain. Not only by wars are souls lost. Ignorance, poverty, and slavery … all are fatal plagues. \nI choose to give to erase the marks ropes left on my arms and ankles. I choose to give because I don't wish to see these marks on any girls skin. I choose to give to bring the “puppet show” to an end. I choose to give not because I have to or need to but because I want to. I choose to give because I am a woman; thus, I am a giver … by nature!! \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/DaughtersForLifeFoundation/?fref=ts&ref=br_tf\nhttp://daughtersforlife.com/",1,

To educate these girls is to save them from the previously mentioned oppression at first. It is also to send them back into society as proactive and fully armed soldiers for the change that is at this point a must for their societies. \n\nThe goal of Daughters for Life Foundation is that of utmost dedication to the empowerment of girls in the middle east which consequently reveals their broader aim of making the middle east a better place. Not only do they help these girls, but they also teach them a set of morals that is essential to their goal. It is a full cycle of effort coming together to raise a new generation based on ambition to make the middle east a far better place then it is now. \n\nI having faced those suffers and being now a scholar of Daughters for Life foundation at Manhattanville college in NY, believe full heartedly in this goal and its effectiveness. I support this foundation and the goal it represents. \n\nThere is a sense of responsibility everyone needs to carry in order for us to make the world better. I believe Daughters for Life foundation are carrying theirs and thus it is a duty to support them.\n\nIt is more then supporting a foundation in this case, it is supporting a generation of bright and dedicated women. \n\nhttp://daughtersforlife.com/",1,1

Our goal with Cranksgiving Little Rock is to be cycling organization that promotes cycling for fun and fitness while seeking to raise awareness for food insecurity through charity bike rides in urban areas. We believe that through our many events and our partnerships with local food banks, we can promote an active socially and environmentally conscious community committed to a healthier life and finding solutions for those affected by hunger in Arkansas. Last year, we gathered 300 pounds of food for Arkansas Rice Depot and this year over 1500 cereal items for the Arkansas Foodbank Cereal Drive.\n \n \nCranksgiving started as one of several annual bike messenger 'alley cat' races in New York City. Each year it is held on the Saturday before Thanksgiving as a way for messengers and other urban cyclists to socialize, compete, and enjoy themselves while also raising food for local soup kitchens or food pantries in time for the Thanksgiving holiday. It is one of the only alley cats focused on raising donations for good causes. Ever since its beginnings in 1999 it has been adopted by organizers in numerous cities in one form or another where all types of cyclists participate to have fun while benefitting a local charity.\n \nEven though the roots of Cranksgiving began among hard working messengers, with its spread the event also demonstrates how almost any person can use their bicycle as a means of transportation for typical shopping errands. As a result, cycling reduces an individual's dependence on expensive automobiles and the ever increasing cost of gas. Riding a bicycle also contributes to a person's good health through exercise and the resulting reduction of air and noise pollution. A bike also reconnects people to their communities by slowing them down a little and providing exposure to a person's neighbors and surrounding environment.\n \nCranksgiving functions as a charity food drive, which is different than most bike messenger 'alley cat' races. However, it is also very different from other alley cats in the manner it is structured. Instead of a straight race between a start and a finish or between multiple check points going from one check point to another, Cranksgiving involves numerous checkpoints with several choices and routing options. The idea behind this race structure is to mimic the average work day of a courier. During a messenger's work day he or she might be assigned any number of package deliveries addressed to different destinations at any time. The courier then has to adapt his or her routing plan to accommodate changes and still be as efficient as possible. Cranksgiving attempts to replicate that somewhat random element of a messenger work day, but in an enjoyable, competitive, and charitable way. Cranksgiving therefore is not all about speed, but also about thoughtful logistic planning.\n\n\n \n \n",3,2

My family instilled in me the value of gratitude, connecting with others and giving back. Living life with the notion that we are all connected through love and compassion, has helped me feel bound to others. If there is need, I want to help. I am grateful to give. It helps me grow and become a woman I am proud to be. In this life, it is not the material possessions that we take with us in the end, but the experiences and relationships we have gathered throughout our years. This belief has led me to supporting a nonprofit that provides these experiences and connections, for not only myself, but the global community.\n\nThe Capital District YMCA (CDYMCA) is a nonprofit organization that has been a constant in my life for over 10 years. There are many ways to give back; through your time, your thoughts/ideas, your advocacy, and your monetary resources. My CDYMCA story of giving crosses all of these avenues. The CDYMCA opened doors for me at a young age as a summer camp counselor, to see the power of nonprofits and raising resource for the community. The impact of this nonprofit is all encompassing (childcare, global awareness, wellness, youth empowerment, community building, resources for children with life threatening illnesses, care for the homeless), which is why I care so strongly about giving to them.\n\nThe experience of giving back that completely changed the course of my life, was with the CDYMCA. While working as a director for a branch of the CDYMCA, I was given the opportunity to give my resources as a fundraiser and time as a volunteer on a service project trip to Vietnam. The service project included cultural immersion, construction at a local Vietnamese school, as well as education outreach. I volunteered on this journey because of my background in education and community action, as well as my innate drive to help others. From there, I catapulted into my life’s purpose, knowing that I was meant to connect with the world on an international level with mindfulness. This experience of giving my time as a volunteer and resources as a fundraiser was incredibly meaningful to me. I am forever tied to the CDYMCA, grateful for their guidance and an opportunity to look deeper into myself to unearth my passion. Because of this experience, I continue to give back to the CDYMCA.\n\nThough there is supposed to be an ending to every story, my story of giving does not include one. I will continue to support this nonprofit organization so that others have the chance to feel the impact of giving; sharing their time, their ideas, their resources with others. I now serve on the Branch Advisory Council and Association Committee for Diversity, Inclusion and Global work at the CDYMCA. I am inspired to continue giving my thoughts and advocacy back to the CDYMCA. As a young summer camp counselor, I never could have imagined this journey with the CDYMCA taking me here; sitting at a table with council members, guiding decisions and sharing ideas at a high level for this organization.\n\nI am inspired to give because I care deeply about others and the CDYMCA does too. I have found an organization that my heart feels at home with. Through the daily grind of business and the nonprofit world, the CDYMCA continues to stay connected to their mission, as well as the community. I give back because it is my hope that this cycle will continue. Someone else will give, and realize their passion or purpose. Someone else will give and make a difference in the lives of others through wellness, education, or outreach. I am inspired to give, so that others may experience the impact of giving.\n\nFind out more about the Capital District YMCA here: http://cdymca.org/",3,3

Supporting my interest humanitarian work at age 8 my mother would take me to events to where I met world leaders such as Dr.Larry Dossey, Dr. Bernie Siegel, Deepak Chopra, Marianne Williamson, Dr.Oz, Wayne Dyer, and Amma. \n\nIt wasn’t until I became a champion volunteer for the educational non-profit and social enterprise Free the Children and Me to WE’s event We Day that I learned about the power of the non-profit sector and what social enterprise was. I have had the pleasure to meet, learn from, and spend time with co-founders Marc and Craig Kielburger who I believe are masters of helping connect our world as one thru empowering individuals with the opportunity to engage in a local to global community and recognize their own gifts in helping our collective society to bringing local to global communities together to create positive development. I have served with the organization since 2013 to present as a champion volunteer. Free the Children is a non-profit that provides education, health-care, alternative income, and agriculture to developing communities, Me to We a social enterprise creating products supporting the communities of Free the Children, and WE Day an educational initiative. Millions of lives have been impacted as result of this incredible organization. \n\nAfter listening to Marc and Craig Kielburger speak at my first We Day I was inspired back to where my personal journey began. I knew at age 18 I wanted to return to the Neonatal/NICU Community once spiritually and mentally read. WE Day gave me the confidence to take the first step to do so. Since then life has drastically changed. I began a healing journey that has even lead me to Brazil to perform a non-traditional medical shadow under renowned healer/humanitarian John of God. I have since been inspired to startup a nonprofit The Neonatal Womb Foundation.  I am so grateful that Free the Children helped inspire this journey. \n\nBorn at The University of Washington Medical Center Neonatal Intensive Care Unit(NICU) at 24 weeks gestation I lost my twin brother Cruz Campos due to extreme premature birth. At 3 weeks old I encountered open heart surgery with no anesthesia weighing 1 pound 3 ounces. As a NICU resident for 4 months I experienced multiple brain bleeds, multiple blood transfusions, & battled chronic lung disease. As a critical neonate, I had the blessing of receiving great care from both traditional and non-traditional medical professionals. After great care and continuous steroid use for over a year, I was healed: drug and complication free. Considering the average outcome of such premature births, I truly feel blessed. It is what motivates me to give back to the NICU community.\n\nAt 21 years of age I came back into the NICU at University of Washington Medical Center as a volunteer. I have reconnected with many staff members that took care of me as an infant, NICU Staff, and NICU families. I have witnessed many NICU stories that inspire me.\n\nServing as a Neonatal Advisory Board, Council Member it came to my attention that providing a means of resource support, connectivity, and empowerment to the NICU Community on a global level is drastically needed in order to intervene & create sustainable outcomes in preventing Neonatal fatalities world-wide.  The ability to provide access to stable long-lasting resource support for NICU parents so that an empowering & healing experience along their NICU journey may become achievable is needed & viable.\n\nIt is my personal story, continuing journey, & passion for the NICU community that fuels my belief in providing diverse clinical, technological, spiritual, community, material, & medical aid support resources to NICU communities globally so that the Light of Hope can be provided to All. \n\nWhen a Neonatal baby is born the womb that once was is recreated by all within the NICU unit for the baby/babies and their parents.  Our mission is to provide NICU babies, parents, families, staff, and facilities the tools to aid in forming that womb. \n\nThrough our foundation we will provide diverse resource support that allows the parents/caretakers to adjust the light and volume within the experience to best fit their needs, abilities and NICU journey. Our local and global outreach programs will work together towards empowering the Neonatal community thru engaging educational, technological, social, and medical aid support. We seek to connect The Neonatal Womb Partners and create solutions towards a stronger, healthier, and cost effective Womb for all.\n\nAt this time are just starting our organization and working on launching our first pilot project. We are also writing a book The Neonatal Womb Foundation and intend to engage our collective NICU Community in contributing their stories into the book to support the global NICU Community and organizations mission as well as display to the community itself the dynamic of The Neonatal Womb from the Womb itself. \n\nOur big picture mission includes-\nDOMESTIC OUTREACH OBJECTIVES –\n•We will provide support to NICU facilities through locally donated technological, educational, spiritual, and communal resources and materials.\n•We will help NICU parents and caretakers through our Parent Navigator Support Program which will include a NICU Family Journal and a Neonatal Womb Foundation NICU support APP.\n•We will provide donated or recycled laptops and tablets to NICU facilities for families to utilize while in the NICU.\n•We will compile book sharing our story along with various neonatal womb experiences and best practices to aid the NICU community.\nGLOBAL OUTREACH OBJECTIVES –\n•We will facilitate donation of recycled NICU-related medical equipment, materials, supplies, aide, and educational resources from domestic medical facilities and affiliates to global NICU communities.\n•We will aid in connecting our domestic NICU community to impressive global wisdom, practices, and data to enhance the neonatal womb experience.\n•Using a volunteer program and Neonatal Womb Foundation partnerships, we will provide professional healthcare providers, train qualified local staff, and build or fortify NICU units.Through our foundation partnerships, we will supply clean water and spirulina farming technology and projects to aid in decreasing early births and bettering mother-infant health.\n\nThe Neonatal Womb Foundation can be found at www.theneonatalwomb.org \n\nI thank Free the Children, Me to We, and WE Day for inspiring me to start this journey into the non-profit sector. They are an organization that I continue to volunteer for in both Seattle and Vancouver BC, purchase products for gifts, and donate to a few times per year. For anyone wishing to get involved in an organization that not only supports a great mission but supports multiple causes and organizations worldwide I highly recommend getting involved locally with We Day, you never know where it may lead you next. \n",1,2

At an age when the gray hairs and wrinkles might set the tone for what’s to come, I eagerly look ahead as I watch some special family dreams come true. The most treasured people in my life, my two children, are on the path to finish college. But far beyond that, I’m in awe as I witness them thriving in their educational experiences. All that my husband and I worked so hard for, over so many years, is paying off – big time. Our kids will not only realize their college dreams, they will have the chance to fulfill their tremendous potential and make their own marks on the world.\n\n End of story, right? Oddly, for me, not so much, because with every proud parental sigh comes a pause. A pause accompanied by a barrage of questions invading my thoughts: What about the kids who don’t have resources and guidance? What if we’d been another family? A family facing financial struggles or racial inequality? What if our kids attended poorly funded schools or lived in a gang-impacted neighborhood? Would their futures be so bright? Would they feel so ready to tackle each new challenge and believe in themselves with such certainty?\n\nI know the answers even before I finish asking. And my eyes tear up as I think about all the children like my own – bright, creative, hard-working, ready to think deeply and dream big – kids born into hardship and poverty just as easily as wealth and privilege, a stroke of luck the only thing separating their circumstances. Surely every child deserves limitless possibilities? Especially the child whose family struggles in a world that has coldly turned its back?\n\nBecause I see how arbitrarily opportunity can be dealt, I give my time to help tell the stories of the kids at Breakthrough Silicon Valley. To try, even in a small way, to right a fundamental wrong. \n\nAs an organization committed to launching motivated, yet under-resourced youth on the path to college, Breakthrough Silicon Valley makes good on a promise to every child – bright, creative, hard-working, and ready to think deeply – that regardless of their background or family circumstances, each deserves the right to dream big and have the chance to realize their full potential. I give my time to Breakthrough, so that Amparo, a young man who has tirelessly worked two jobs from the age of twelve to help support his family, while juggling the demands of school, can earn a four-year college degree and change the trajectory of his young life. At Breakthrough Silicon Valley, low-income students like Amparo find the resources and guidance they need, just as any young person does, to realize their dreams.\n",3,2

The letter tells the story.  Here is the letter.\nDear Eric and PPRAC family,\nI’d like to tell you a story. We all have them. Stories are\nthe shortest distance between two people.\n\nWe would have lunch  weekly, Eric and  I.   We  were introduced by a colleague and as she had anticipated, Eric became my friend.   During these lunches, we shared stories, I learned of his family, his work and his interests. He talked passionately about biking and being part of a team of people that would ride for cancer -\nhis preparation for the ride, the route to be taken, his reasons for being part of it.\nWhen  it  came  time  for  seeking  out contributors, I was happily among them.\n\nOn a Saturday evening last spring, while hosting an Archery Banquet/Picnic at our home, with 50+ people enjoying the weather and beautiful sunset in our backyard, I received a call from my doctor. ‘We have a problem’.  That problem turned into the word ‘cancer’.  This would be the second time in my life that I have heard that word. 30 years separated the calls. It felt different this time, maybe because I was 55 not 25, maybe because I had more to lose, maybe because this one was bad, really bad.   I had a new purpose now, to find the best medical care, get a clear diagnosis, develop a plan for treatment and stay alive.\n\nIt would be 9 months before I would make the connection between my journey with cancer and each of your journey with the PPRAC family and preparing for the PPRAC Ride and all I imagine that entails - seeking donations, conditioning your body, maintenance to your equipment, creating the support team and finally putting your feet in those pedals every day for over 500 miles.\n\nYou pedaled 100 miles the first day and raised money for the American Cancer Society.     I, like others on this journey, received a ‘chemo bag’, at no cost to me. Simple items, but each with its own importance in a world I was about to enter. The bag contained products and answers that would help prepare me for the treatments, manage the side effects and comfort me.  I revisited the bag at each new challenge and it would hand me what I needed to manage it.\n\nYou pedaled 100 miles the second day and raised money for the American Cancer Society. I, like others on this journey, received counseling from a psychologist with the American Cancer Society at no cost to me.   Transitioning from a career and working full time and enjoying an active lifestyle with my husband of 30 years to becoming sick and a cancer patient was a bigger elephant than I could handle.  Through counseling, I was able to prepare myself for my new purpose, which is to get well.  I eat the elephant one bite at time and my life is better having learned this.\n\nYou pedaled 100 miles the third day and raised money so that I and other women, whose entire body is changed significantly by chemotherapy and other  treatments,  would  have  a  new  vision  of ourselves.   I found myself staring at a stranger in the mirror. Unsettling and for some, tragic. At no cost to me, I was invited to a ‘Feel Good, Look Good’ class on how to take care of my skin, how to apply makeup that would highlight my best features and minimize those that made me look sick.   I received a bag of cosmetics, $150 in value, which transformed my face but more importantly, I gained confidence. This event took a frightening and sometimes depressing internal process and helped me walk away smiling and feeling good about myself\n\nYou put your - by now - tired and sore muscles on your bike and pedaled those remaining miles the third, fourth and fifth day to raise money for the American Cancer Society. I got the gift of the American Cancer Society Hope Lodge in New York City. At no cost to us.  I went to Memorial Sloane Kettering Cancer Center to receive an Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplant. I would spend 34 days in the hospital. First receiving 10 days of 5\nchemotherapy drugs that would destroy my biological existence (DNA) and wreak havoc on most of my functioning organs and systems. This was followed by the gift of life in stem cells from my brother Neal, given to me on my new birthday, January 25th. It is a requirement of the Bone Marrow Transplant Team than I live within 5 miles of the hospital for 100 days post-transplant. The risks to me without an immune system and recovering from the devastation to my body are considerable. My husband moved me to my new home for the next 3 months, the ACS Hope Lodge. The staff greeted us with open arms into an atmosphere of hope and healing and where the practical and emotional needs are met through the staff, programs, fellow patients and even the doorman. Hope Lodge is a safe, clean and controlled environment which allowed me and my caregiver to do what was most important, progress through those critical 100 days. On a weekly\nbasis the Hope Lodge offered to both the caregivers and guests, as the patients are called, a variety of offerings which could entertain a much weary caregiver or\nintroduce the guest back into the real world. They offered events like cooking demonstrations, needlecraft lessons, massages, book discussions, music played by local artists and college kids providing entertainment. It was always unconditional. You came if you were feeling up to it.\nThat is a rare gift to a cancer patient. expected When in our world there is so much guilt about being sick, the ACS Hope Lodge never, they asked ‘What do you\nneed?’\n\nMy friendship with Eric has brought many rich moments\nto my life. One has been PPRAC. You have given me a gift – the understanding of the connection between what you do and how it changes lives. During a time of fear, confusion, anger and grief, I thought of all of you and what you create for us.  You make a difference.\n\n\nThank you, Ellen Kalinosky\n\n",1,1

As a professional, I have always been inspired to give back to  youth and families through therapeutic services, volunteer opportunities and through donating to organizations that focused on the overall wellbeing of underserved children and families. When I first heard about the mission of the Zane Beadles Parade Foundation, as well as all of the incredible financial and emotional support the foundation provides to children and families going through life-changing medical experiences, I knew that this was one such organization I would happily donate funds to on a regular basis. Because the Zane Beadles Parade Foundation aims to focus on children battling cancer, I felt a personal connection to their mission as well as the work that I provide to children and families on a regular basis. Several of my families, including those that come from underserved and impoverished communities, cannot emotionally and financially afford the devastating impact that a diagnosis of cancer has on their family. Most importantly, a diagnosis of cancer can lend itself to delicate and challenging conversations regarding daily medical decisions, work-family adjustments and a flooding of intense and often scary emotions. The devastation and magnitude of a diagnosis of cancer is especially difficult for parents who love and care for their children and want the best for their future. All too often, this reality can be too much for one family to handle alone. \n\nThe Zane Beadles Parade Foundation addresses the multi- stressed nature of medical diagnoses on a family system in a gentle, supportive, friendly and fun manner. Not only is  their symbol of an elephant a symbol of strength, family commitment and emotional wellness, it also communicates to children that they are strong, resilient, and just like an elephant--can walk through this season of life without fear or shame. How precious is that? That this foundation, above the rest, can meet a child and their family exactly where they're at, and with a gentle approach in mind. This, to me, is exactly what a family going through a crisis needs to know--that they are loved, they will be cared for financially and emotionally, and that their child is in good hands. What could be better than that? As a family therapist working with families who come in with these delicate life situations, I am grateful for the support Zane's Parade provides to our greater community.

I came across a great nonprofit organization called Blind Cat Rescue & Sanctuary. They have an amazing shelter and take in cats who are fully or legally blind. They give the cats a beautiful place to live and play, provide them with love, plenty of toys, cat beds and perches, food and water. They allow the community to come in and visit with the cats so they always get plenty of attention and play time with humans as well. They do not allow the cats to be adopted out, as they feel they have been through enough and serve to give the cats a forever home right there at the Sanctuary. There is one woman behind the whole organization and she is an angel to these cats! I fell in love with the cause immediately. These amazing cats, who were so helpless, are being given a second chance to live a full, happy life. So, instead of asking Santa for gifts, I purchased food and supplies for the Blind Cat Rescue & Sanctuary. I have a roof over my head and plenty of food on the table.

Some may call these moments happiness. Other times, moments bring you face to face with fear and for some of us that means death. Those who experience a traumatic experience have a hard time detaching the emotion from a memory such as this. From the moment a traumatic incident happens, a haunting voice tells you ”you shouldn't have survived”. The memories constantly bring up feelings of terror, fear, anger and sadness. You are tied to the constructs of the mind, and if you are constantly in a state of fear or anger or sadness, you never let those emotions subside. A black cloud hovers over you waiting to take your life, if you don't make the decision first. When forced to face death, a new perspective on life is born. \n\nAt 17 years of age, I was involved in a traumatic car accident. Six hours after the time of the accident, I finally received medical help. I was rushed to the nearest trauma center and quickly accessed for injuries. After x-rays and recovering my temperature from hypothermic levels, the doctor announced I needed emergency surgery. The nurses brought my loved ones into the room, and told them to say their goodbyes, they were not sure if I would survive the procedure. In this moment, I looked death straight in the face and went under anesthesia not knowing if I would wake up.\n\nComing into adulthood with a traumatic experience like this, lead me spiraling downward, doubting my existence. “Why did I survive?!”, I would constantly question. I truly did not believe I deserved the second chance I was afforded. Psychologists put me on antidepressants, which took a year of my life. The chemical shift in my brain chemistry made me numb, numb to one of the most basic human experiences, emotion. This numbness perpetuated into everything I did.\n\nIt was time to find a new medicine, so I left the pharmaceuticals behind and began to explore my consciousness.\n  \nWith the help of Blue Morpho, I was able to take this experience and let it ignite my passion for life rather than perpetuate my fear of living. I was able to see clearly the simple shift in conscious awareness of the emotions I experienced, separating my memory from the reality of the present moment. Instead of wondering why I survived, doubting my second chance, I now see my place in the world as a vital part of this existence. I can see the moment I almost left the world, as a significant impact on the loved ones around me. All the apparent tragedy in that hospital room was actually filled with copious amounts of love.\n\nHamilton Souther and Blue Morpho Foundation opened up the hood of my brain and tinkered with the igniter and the starter and reprogrammed them so I realize, I am the one actually doing the tuning up. Humans were blessed with so much power: choice, free will, conscious awareness, mindful knowledge and emotional intelligence, so why not utilize these tools in balance with one another to navigate through this reality. With a simple change in perspective, a technique I learned through my work with Blue Morpho, I finally understood, that I had a choice. A choice to let my emotions overwhelm me, or to take control back and use the other tools I have in my back pocket.\n\nNow, I love myself fully, no one can ever take that from me, and my relationship with myself is the most important relationship to foster and care for. When you love yourself, the memories, the shame and all the judgments melt away. Stillness and peace infiltrate the mind, body and soul. Without Blue Morpho, I would not be following my passions in life. I would have been sucked in the dark whole of mental illness that American society is so quick to compartmentalize trauma sufferers into. \n\nThat is why I give – because I found a nonprofit that truly changes lives.

Four years later I became a member of the Crusader family.  The Crusaders gave me a vehicle to share my passions as a young musician and performer.  They gave me the ability to entertain and perform in front of tens of thousands of people in the best venues in the country.   Not only did I get opportunities to perform but I learned numerous life lessons along the way.  I learned that success does not happen without hard work.  I learned that even though you may experience failure you cannot succeed without having determination and being persistent.  I learned how to work with over 100 people under sometimes adverse conditions to achieve a common goal.  I continue to benefit from my marching years in the Crusaders by applying the lessons I learned in my life.  The continued friendships (and new ones) I made over 25 years ago enrich my life and provide a link to a shared history.  \n\nNone of the lessons I learned could have happened without the support from alumni, staff, volunteers, fans and friends of the corps.  The Boston Crusaders (past and present) could not have achieved success without the people that helped us get down the road; the drivers, the cooks and other volunteers.  Our instructional staff, who were all volunteers were the best and provided an environment to allow us to overachieve as a corps and as individuals.  This couldn’t have happened without the support of the Board of Directors and Administrative Staff that put it all together.  Of course, all this required funds to pay the bills for the buses, equipment and food to feed the corps on the road.  Our financial supporters, who bought souvenirs, show or raffle tickets, or who made donations helped make this happen.\n\nI give to the Boston Crusaders because I want to support the “corps we love” like those that did when I was a member, and those before that.  I give to the Boston Crusaders because I want the legacy of the Boston Crusaders to continue for another 75 years.

I was picked on for not looking feminine enough, having a deep voice, and not acting the same way as other girls, among other things. Until I was 21 years old, I was a closeted lesbian, and had extreme difficulty coming to terms with that part of my identity. I got used to brushing it off when I was bullied, and denied that it even bothered me. It wasn’t until I had qualified for the U.S. Olympic Trials and accepted a scholarship to my dream school for swimming that I really began to feel the weight of that on me. I had reached my highest goals and accomplished things that no one ever expected me to do, but I was unable to excel and make the most of those accomplishments.\n\nBeing gay clashed with what I wanted. It posed a threat to my goals, dreams, and relationships. I saw the way that gay athletes and students were treated by some of the people I cared about most in the world, knowing that would be the way they treated me if they knew I was struggling with my identity. Because of this, I battled depression and struggled with school and swimming until I had reached an all-time low. I left my dream school, unable to finish swimming with the team I had wanted to be on since I was just 8 years old. I thought my swimming career and my life as I knew it were over. But I was wrong. \n\nAt 21, I came out as an openly gay swimmer after transferring to the University of Arizona. At first I was unsure about how my life was going to change and the negative consequences I might have to face. Soon after, Campus Pride was one of a few organizations that reached out to me. The love, acceptance, and sense of family they shared with me were game changers. After years of feeling hopeless, angry, and frustrated with myself for being different, I began to see that my differences were important.\n\nWhat I find unique about Campus Pride was the influence they have in so many different areas. Every summer, they have Camp Pride, where LGBTQ students and straight allies from around the U.S. travel to talk about social justice issues and plan to take action on campus. They have tools for assessing campus sports teams and identifying safe places for LGBTQ athletes. They also work to identify LGBTQ friendly colleges and university campuses across the U.S., giving high school students a way to find a campus with safe spaces.\n\nCampus Pride has inspired me in a million and one ways, but mostly they’ve inspired me to do everything in my power to make sure other LGBT athletes don’t feel ashamed of themselves and live with the bad experiences that I had. Campus Pride made me realize that I didn’t deserve the way that I was treated because of my differences, and that I can do good things for others by drawing on my experience.\n\nI can’t stress enough how big of a role Campus Pride has played in my journey. I’m grateful to them for changing the lives of young LGBTQ students who suffer from depression and struggle with bullying the way I did. I give to Campus Pride because I want to give back to an organization that helped give me my life and my self-confidence back. By giving to Campus Pride, we can make sure they’re able to change the lives of LGBTQ youth who might otherwise feel lost.\n\nCampus Pride url: https://www.campuspride.org/\n",1,1

We had a small extended family but we visited them infrequently, mainly around holidays. For my brother and I, mom was our whole world. Even as we became adults and moved on through life, she was there. She had always worked very hard and as she approached possible retirement in her 60s, she received devastating news. \n\nMy mother was diagnosed with stage IV renal cancer in the spring of 2007. At that time, the projected life expectancy did not exceed five years. But, we thought she could be the one to beat those odds. Her first surgery was the removal of one tumored kidney. She would spend the following year medication free. The doctors felt there was no need to start additional treatment until there was further activity. In the spring of 2008, a tumor was found on her femur, very close to her hip. She had the bone removed and replaced with a titanium rod. After healing from the surgery, rounds of radiation and chemotherapy were scheduled. The next five years were a roller coaster ride of springtime diagnoses and new types of treatment. \n\nIn November 2013, we received the worst news. The doctors felt that all treatment options had been exhausted and it was time to consult with a hospice organization. My mother, brother and I had always believed the cancer would eventually go away if she had one more surgery or one more round of chemo. Unfortunately, the cancer had other plans. It was invading her body from head to toe. She had exceeded that five year death sentence but it was difficult to feel grateful when we did not want to lose her. \n\nWe consulted with a local hospice organization and signed her up for their services. Her biggest fear was dying in a retirement home or hospital. She made us promise to avoid that as much as possible. Thankfully, it is the mission of a hospice to support the wishes of patients and their families. This was ideal for our situation.  \n\nThe next few months were stressful for everyone. My mom had been very independent her entire life so to find herself mostly helpless was tough for her to bear. As time went on, her mobility decreased. She would spend part of the day in her living room chair watching her favorite show, “Duck Dynasty.” It was an odd choice for my artsy mother but something about their antics made her laugh, a lot. She would keep my daughters and I current on the show every time we visited. Her bed was the only other spot where she would stay. My brother, sister-in-law and I would alternate shifts to check on her and to make sure she was eating. We would also try to get her moving around a bit to help her maintain mobility. As this was happening, we had the assistance of the hospice social worker, nurse and home aide. \n\nMom died around 5 am on May 8, 2014, in her own bed, just the way she wanted. The following months were strange. I had not noticed how the years as a caregiver effected me. I was devastated. I had a tough time articulating my grief and would often cry suddenly. I hated to hear things like “at least she’s not in pain anymore” or “she isn’t sick anymore.” The good intentions were understood but I just could not bear to hear it out loud. I was very happy that she was not sick but selfishly, I still wanted her here. I still wanted to bring her breakfast, help her walk, whatever she needed. \n\nI realized the grief was easing as spring rolled around again. I also started to feel like something was missing in my life. For seven years, there had always been a doctor’s appointment, hospital visit, prescription to pick up or something. That all seemed to end abruptly and I had a tough time figuring out what to do. There were plenty of “things” to do but there was an emptiness. I reached out to a hospice organization seeking volunteers. My goal was to provide support for the patient, as well as their caregiver(s). My experience provided me with an understanding of what they would go through. However, I was not sure if I would be more emotional or helpful.\n\nI have been a volunteer patient visitor for a few months and my emotions have stayed in check. I am grateful for the opportunity. The time I spend with a patient has been extremely rewarding. I feel like I am the one benefiting. I know my mom would be proud of me.   \n\nhttp://www.caringhospice.com/Netscape/index.html\n",1,2

The volunteer rate for young adults is 18.7%. \nI give because of the impact the program had on me and all of the other college students who are involved with the program. The program instills an inherent sense of charity, compassion, and care for others in our community. It reveals the sides of society that, as a college student, I may have otherwise been unaware. I give because the only way to truly gain that perspective is by interacting in person, and I believe that to be valuable for all individuals.\nAs a society, we know that the cycle of poverty is a terrible institution, and incredibly difficult to change. We also know that in order to make large sweeping changes, money cannot make the difference, but that the culture must support the change. That, above all else, is why I give.. because mentoring works. It changes the story for the mentees, and empowers the mentors to make valuable decisions as they grow into future leaders. \nI give because College Mentors changes the culture, and extrapolated out, can help change the world.\n\n\nhttp://www.collegementors.org/\n",,1

The loss of a great job, bills 2 months overdue, bare cupboards, a cold, harsh Montana winter upon us, and warm clothes needed.\n Swallowing down a big lump of pride, a mother does what she has to do, to ensure the survival of her young, and put the trust back into their wondering minds of, if their needs would be met.  \nI walked into the Community Hope in Laurel, Mt and signed up for a food box and as the volunteer workers prepared the groceries, I browsed the little shop of donated goods for articles of clothing. \nThere were many racks and shelves and a lot to look through, as I focused my eyes to narrow down my search to just color and size, I spotted the cutest crocheted  hat and scarf set.\n I couldn't believe it, it was everything my daughter would have dreamed of owning, and would wear proudly.

At the time, women who were pregnant out of marriage were given few choices and often had to 'go live with an aunt' to protect the family's reputation in their community.  Fortunately this stigma has changed in our society, but the problems a woman faces in a crisis pregnancy have not.\n\nWhen Crisis Pregnancy Outreach (www.cpotulsa.org) began in the early 1980s, many of the women who came to us were teenagers who did not want to have an abortion.  Today, CPO works in coordination with local hospitals and operates a 24 hour hotline.  The majority of woman we now serve are homeless; addicted to drugs/alcohol, gambling, or relationships; physically abused; and/or are totally alone.  \n\nWhat I love about CPO is that we make a lifetime commitment to these women.  It is not just about the 9 months of pregnancy. This crisis brings women to CPO, but this is only the presenting problem. Our goal is to provide the services necessary to help women move forward out of a very difficult situation to live heathy, productive lives. CPO provides a plethora of programs, which include, living assistance (utilities, food, clothing); childbirth classes, educational and employment assistance, life skills seminars, medical care with a private physician and dentist, mentoring, parenting classes, transportation, weekly support groups, and a storage area with maternity/children clothes, child-rearing supplies (cribs, diapers, toys, et al), and furniture. \n\nCPO facilitates a mentoring program that forms relationships between the CPO women and other women/mothers.  These volunteers meet with them weekly and often incorporate them into their own family activities.  The purpose of this relationship is to encourage healthy living, academic achievement, and generate educational and career interests. CPO began as a grassroots organization, but has continued to develop into a well-run organization where I am proud to volunteer.\n\nSince the beginning, some of the women stay in volunteer homes, some continue to live on their own, but as we grew, CPO was also able to purchase a Transitional Home where up to eight woman at a time can live. This is a lovely residential home where the women are provided three meals a day, a study area, medicines, transportation to appointments, schooling, tutoring, counseling and mentoring. Once a birth mother is settled in, she is encouraged to begin advancing her education by going to school (high school, tech, or college) or taking the GED.  She also is provided a personal, professional counselor who she can see at no charge.  What a privilege it is to see women put into practice what they learn and become more self-sufficient.  Many holding jobs for the first time and purchasing their first cars!\n  \nDuring the time the birth mother is pregnant, she makes a very difficult decision to raise or relinquish her child. If she chooses to relinquish her child, the mother looks through life-books submitted by the adoptive families and selects her baby’s family.  These are open adoptions, which means she will have a relationship with the family and her child.  Most years CPO facilitates 20 -30 adoptions. We offer programs for waiting/adoptive parents, conduct interviews and home visits, provide workshops, support groups, mentoring, and hosting for out-of-town families. It is so heartwarming to see the adoptive parents, the birth mother, and the child come to love and respect each other.  It is a process that also requires lots of work and emotional risk on everyone's part, but CPO is committed to the children to provide for them a loving home AND the knowledge of where they came from.\n\nIn the last few years, more women are choosing to parent as single mothers. CPO has expanded our services to meet the many needs of these women to provide healthy, safe homes for their children. We teach classes to prepare her to be intentional in her child-rearing practices; we help her get started living on her own; and CPO continues to provide counseling and support groups for as long as the mother is willing to attend. Many CPO women stay in Tulsa and continue counseling, attend parenting classes/small groups, finish their education, and become part of the CPO community -- helping each other. We now have children who were born with CPO who are in their 30s.  What a joy to see the adults they have become and to know that we have played a small part in giving them a positive future.\n\nFinally, what I love about CPO, and why I am willing to invest my time, talent, and treasure with this organization is that it is 100% volunteer.  In 35 years, no one has received a salary.  All the monies raised go directly to helping women and children and the tangible expenses to run the office and the transitional home.  What a privilege to watch these many loving, talented and dedicated women come alongside another woman in crisis and walk with her through one of the most traumatic times in her life.  Many are available 24 hours a day to go to the hospital, answer the hotline, provide transportation, baby showers, and events for the children.  Many of these volunteers have been with CPO for 10 - 25 years, a few for all 35 years.  They are seasoned, loving women who understand the unique struggles of being a young woman in a crisis situation.  My role has been small compared to the sacrifices of their time, talents, and treasure; nevertheless, I have reaped a deep sense of hope for our future as I watch lives changed for the better with CPOs caring human touch.\n\n\n\n",3,2

But, as I stared into the dark, I would remember my newest acrobatic piece. Middle school was rough and nothing I looked forward to but I got out of bed each morning because I wanted to try out my new performance ideas. While dressing and packing, I would begin to excitedly pace around the room planning which of my fellow performers would stand where, how we could climb up each other, and what kind of music would play. Soon I felt thrilled to be awake and moving and even more so to have a purpose in my life. \n\nEcho Theater Company (http://www.echotheaterpdx.org/) gave me a place where, at a young age, I could contribute my energy and passion. Echo Theater’s youth company was the first place where people – children and adults – really listened to my ideas. Our directors, Wendy Cohen and Aaron Wheeler-Kay, led the group but we were expected to collaborate with each other to create our performances. The group consisted of other middle and high school aged youth and together we discovered how to give to a group effort – sometimes by proposing ideas and sometimes by agreeing to let them go for the good of the whole performance. \n\nThis learning process was sometimes challenging as we struggled to find a way to be heard and to listen. I remember the rehearsals for one piece in which we constantly argued over parts until Aaron suggested we use these squabbles to create a comical act. The piece became fun and delightful to perform because it was so honest to our actual experience of collaboration. “Art mirrors life,” Aaron chuckled. When I look back at the five years I spent in Echo Theater’s youth company, I can’t help but wonder if life also mirrors art. As I learned to communicate, to be brave with my contributions, humble with my desire for recognition, and to value, above all, the success of the collective group, I became a more confident and considerate person outside of the theater. \n\nNow I am twenty-five. I am not a professional acrobat or a theater director but I care deeply about community. I have worked in Latin America and the US for social justice and children’s rights.  I care about the needs of others and I am confident that my ideas and passion can make a difference.

This program would have helped greatly during our early years of parenthood.  There are children who need the support for a variety of reasons and this really hit home for me.  \n\nWith the help of that friend from lunch and my incredibly supportive husband, along with the Newmarket Community Church who allows us to house our program at their Thrift Store in a 100 square foot room, we launched End 68 Hours of Hunger Newmarket in February 2015.

I am lucky that my parents and family can afford the food I need.  If you go to the store and get food that I can’t eat, like cornbread, then it would be so much cheaper like $1.30.

So, some people barely have the money to even afford cornbread, but if you go to FEI, you can get what you need to eat for free.  So, I think that FEI is great because some people can’t afford that, but it has made a change in a bunch of people’s lives.

There is ongoing research, but it's a very slow process with limited funding, and if you're the one suffering, a cure cannot come too soon.  Even an effective treatment to stop or slow the progression would be helpful.  People usually decline between 5 to 8 years before dying from the disease.  No one has beat it yet, but there's always hope.  Please consider this very worthy organization as your non-profit charity.

She battled an extremely rare neurodegenerative disease called Progressive Supra Nuclear Palsy (PSP) for over 6 years, slowly losing ground.\n\nHaving to deal with an unexpected sudden death of a loved one is a terrible place to be in. On the contrary, awareness of an impending death is like having to look at an archer slowly sharpen his arrow, with the full knowledge that is being prepared for you and can strike you anytime. You are then at the mercy of a flick of his/His finger. We witnessed this process in all its glory for over 2000 days between 2008 and 2013.\n\n“Hope Matters” is the tagline of Cure PSP, the most prominent PSP care group in the world. And until much later I did not realize the importance of ‘hope’. My mom was a fighter. She fought until the very end. But what matters and what makes her a hero is that she fought with hope until the very end. She knew it was an incurable disease. Yet, she never gave up. She went to every single one of her doctor’s appointments with a hope that there might be some good news waiting for her -- probably some new medicine might have been discovered, or a new surgical procedure might have been found to cure her disease! She never missed a single dose of her medications, hopeful that it will do whatever little good it can. Every time a medication was changed, a dose was altered, she would do her own little test --trying to walk without anyone's support, a task she knew fully well she could not. A test that had almost always ended unfruitfully. Despite some falls and bruises, and multiple rebukes, she would wait for an opportune time, when she could try this without catching anyone's attention. It was only a hope that some medication might have worked and made her condition better.\n\nOne of the later symptoms of PSP is a condition called 'dysphagia.' Here, swallowing becomes increasingly difficult as the disease progresses. Let alone giant pills, swallowing even mashed potatoes becomes an ordeal. In her last few months, despite immense pain and discomfort, she went through this pill-swallowing ordeal four times a day, every single day. Even when we missed giving her a dose, mostly to save her the pain and choking that would follow, she would adamantly ask for the pills and willingly go through the ordeal. For me, that's hope, right there, in its purest form. She was hopeful that someday, someone, somewhere, would find a cure to PSP. She fought until her last breath, quite literally here, as on her last breath she choked on a small sip of water. Until the very end, her mind did not give up. It was her body that betrayed, while her hope was present even in the most hopeless situations.\n\nSo ladies and gentlemen, here's some unsolicited advice. Never lose hope. When you think that you might miss a goal, a bus, a train, a meeting, or a deadline, walk a little faster, run a little longer, work a little smarter, and try a little harder. Like my mom would often say, 'you never know if you are going to make it until you make it.'\n\nWe have supported #CurePSP periodically through small donations. Wearing their 'Hope Matters' wristbands has led to unexpected conversations at unexpected places, giving me a chance to raise awareness. Please #givethanks to CurePSP whose mission it is to raise awareness of this cruel disease and host support group meetings for caregivers and their families. CurePSP also strives to advance research that can cure this Prime of Life debilitating disease. ",1,

They are the “friends” of Abilities First, (working name for the Greene County Board for Developmental Disabilities). The hundreds of people whom they serve every month each have their own unique story; I would like to share with you just one of those stories that has been shared with me,  and I believe you will become one of their champions just as I have! \n This is a true story; the names have been changed to protect the privacy of the family. \nDonnie is the legal guardian of his younger brother, Roger. Let me start by telling you about Donnie, who was propelled into the role of head of the household at a very early age, probably fourteen, maybe younger.  Donnie’s father, Bennie, already in his eighties when Donnie was born, was a strict disciplinarian.  In fact, people who remember him will tell you he was “meaner than a junk yard dog”. Donnie remembers one occasion when, as punishment for some transgression, his dad made him take off his clothes, after which Bennie soaked his son’s body with bug spray. “Burned like hell,” Donnie remarked.  But, incredible as it may seem, Donnie holds no animosity toward his father.  In fact, some ten years after his death at age ninety-three, the room in which the old man died has been locked and never again opened.  Why?  Because Bennie left instructions that it was to be that way. And Donnie never considered anything other than to comply. So it is that Donnie, his wife, his son, his mother and Roger, all live together in the little family home with the room that is never again to be entered.\n To help you understand why I feel so moved to be a part of the work that Friends of Abilities First does, I must fill in a few more details.  Donnie’s mother has always been, or became so as a result of being married to the infamous Bennie, shall we say--a hard woman.  Once she threw a glass of water in Sheryl’s (Donnie’s wife) face just because she wanted to. But she is quite elderly, and nothing is done to alter her behavior—not by Donnie or by Sheryl.  Then there is Donnie’s fourteen-year-old son, Lil’ Donnie.  Lil’ Donnie is “slow”, (as the family puts it), and does not understand why he is forced go to school. He has been put back a year--or maybe two-- and is suspended  (much to his delight)  on a regular basis. He reasons that his dad didn’t finish school, and he does all right working as an aide in a nursing home. His father explains that he quit school to care for his ailing father, to keep him from being put in a nursing home.  And because he didn’t get to complete his education, Donnie exerts every kind of effort to keep his son in school—moving him to a different district when he must, imploring teachers to give him another chance, and literally delivering him to the school door to make sure he actually goes in. \nDonnie’s wife, his third wife—why would anyone stay for long?—is a fragile woman with a heart condition.  She has suffered a lot of abuse in her life.  Living in a home with a roof over her head, even if it occasionally leaks, knowing where her next meal is coming from, is enough to keep her reasonably content.  But, now, you should know a little more about the house. It’s really a tiny little shack; in place of ceiling tile, Donnie has stapled black plastic. The floors are bare wood, splintered and rotted in some places, but Donnie always finds a way to shore up the defects and keep the family relatively safe from falling through.  There is not actually enough room in the house for the whole family, so Donnie and Sheryl sleep in a shed in the back yard, furnished to look, for all practical purposes, like a bedroom.  Remember, one room in the tiny house is perpetually locked, never again to be opened. \n",,

It became a learning experience when we took the tour they offer a couple of times daily. We were amazed to learn just how many big cats are in the hands of private owners. The regulations vary from state to state if there are any regulations at all. The thought that their could be a full grown tiger in the basement of your neighbors house was hard to believe but it is true. We learned that there are more tigers in captivity than there are in the wild. The big problem here is proper care.

The tour guides at Turpentine Creek can give you the back stories on all of the animals now in their care. These stories are pretty sad, often tragic.

I had come to the State Business Leadership Conference mostly for the traveling experience, as the host city for that year, Seattle, Washington, is six hours away from my home town.

My reasons for escaping Atlanta and moving full time to the mountains were typical--I loved to hike, paddle the lakes and rivers, breath fresh air, drink clean water and live in a place where the pace was slower and the community was closer.

Joe gruffly explained that the Forest Service was tasked to 'manage' the National Forest lands, not necessarily protect, and citizens who cared were needed to monitor Forest Service plans and practices involving burning forest, logging trees, spreading chemicals, mining on forest land and building highways through our National Forest .

As the season went on, she became more comfortable and opened up more in practice. The other girls on the team would encourage her, both to speak up and to run. I often ran with her in practice to encourage her to run for longer periods of time before walking because I knew she could do it.

And not just any cats – all cats.  That is, the sick, the overlooked, the depressed – Golden Paw’s volunteers keep an eye out specifically for these “underdogs” of the feline world who often meet the sad fate of languishing away in their shelter cages.  Once rescued by Golden Paw, these underdogs, along with their happier, healthier counterparts, of course, are given the care, love, and attention that they need to thrive, and, furthermore, they are given the opportunity to be adopted by a “Forever Family” through Golden Paw’s adoption center or one of their affiliates.\n\nRescuing cats and providing for their medical care is a costly enterprise, and GPS counts on the generosity of their friends and donors to help make it happen.

I set up shop there to meet low income senior citizens and try to engage with them to show them the kinds of services I can offer  free of charge.  Ways to save on utility bills, plans for having food when the money runs out before the month does, budgeting help, how to escape from being prey to the payday loan companies and so many other services that can make a meager fixed income go much further and last much longer.\n\nThis generation of senior citizens are a unique breed.  They are the aging baby boomers and what I consider the last of the moral few. They grew up with the idea that you should always work hard, scrimp and save, pay your bills and be willing to sacrifice if you can’t.  They grew up without computers or computer education and today know very little about how to navigate most things younger people do from their phones in an instant.\n\nAnd, sadly, they are a generation of lost people.  There are no large scale wars that unite them as a group. Their children were born in the “me” generation of self-centeredness and permissiveness and who, for the most part,  have found keeping generational ties unimportant.  As a result and more often than not, they abandon the older generation as if it is somehow the respectful thing to do.  Today’s seniors are also a generation first to experience the insufficiency of social security income to buy the retirement they had hoped. What are so errantly called the Golden Years are truly as thin and flimsy as aluminum foil.\n\nI work the saddest shift at the non-profit charity I chose to join a year ago today.\n\nMy  open door policy, however, seems to make it a little easier for these needy but ashamed old people to be willing to break the ice.  Like rescue dogs beaten down from years of abuse, they often are afraid to make the first contact. Fortunately, I’m pretty good at that and regularly seek out and engage many solo seniors who have had nobody to talk with for years.  Their lifetime friends are either six feet under or six hundred miles away and they don’t have money for milk much less travel in these Aluminum Years.\n\nAgain, I made the first move.\n\nFor three weeks, he’d passed by while I was in what they called the Library at the senior center. It’s not much of a library, really.  It has a cache of donated old books and magazines piled neatly as if they were new editions.  Nobody is fooled by the name of the room which doubles for bingo on Tuesday afternoons where winners receive rolls of toilet paper as prizes.\n\nI never heard him coming down the hall and mostly only got a glimpse of his profile as he would  pass through the light streaming in the doorway so many times before. Each trip, he always turned his head and proceeded at a steady pace as if on a conveyor belt to nowhere.\n\nIt took some coaxing. I got up from the computer and stood by the door so that the chance meeting might be a little easier for him if it was to happen at all.  He was far down the corridor, head down and without direction.  But he must have heard me or seen my friendly gesture somehow, for as I sat back down, he was right there at the door, seemingly in reciprocation.\n\n“Hey there!,” I spoke loudly as most of the people around here are hard of hearing or not used to being selected for a conversation.\n\nHe looked up and through the doorway. As he came closer, I could see great depth in the crevasses in his face and his long, black feeble shadow met me long before he did.\n\n“How’s it going on this beautiful day?”\n\nHe looked around as if perhaps I was addressing another, more important passerby.  I introduced myself and my reason for being here and asked the same of him.\n\n“I’m Al, and I just need a photograph.”\n\nI invited him to sit awhile and tell me about this photograph he wanted.\n\nAt first, he wasn’t well spoken but when he did, his long grey beard moved in synchronicity with each syllable.  Obviously anxious at the thought of talking with a complete stranger and worse, having a need to present to one, he chose his words very carefully.\n\nAl hadn’t seen his three kids in some time. It had been years for two, perhaps a decade more for the oldest.  He knows he must have grandchildren by now and wonders if one of them might be an Albert or Alan or Allison…named in his memory as if he were already dead and gone.  It’s not likely.  After his wife died in ’84, the kids moved him to this senior living community in the desert where he’d “have a really fun time with all the people his age and the games and the bingo” and all that list of lies he was told as he managed the last $700 of his savings as a deposit when he signed.\n\nHe was all of 81 now, and in addition to winning a roll of toilet paper  now and then, he spends holidays, birthdays and anniversaries alone except when he can get a ride to the library or the cemetery where his wife was laid to rest 30 years earlier. To make best use of the ride and the welcomed time away, he  goes grave to grave to pull weeds, straighten dirty plastic flowers and talks to all the horizontal people mostly his age and older. Except of course Sally, his wife, who only made it a half century before a drunk in a pickup truck ended their marriage and for some reason,  the only real connection to the children and family.\n\nToday, he was missing them and wondering about their well-being. He had their addresses on some scraps of paper he pulled from his wallet as I offered him a cold bottle of water.  There were no phone numbers, just penciled addresses which had blurred illegible after so many years in his wallet next to what looked like high school pictures.\n\nAl hadn’t had a picture taken of him since he could remember.\n\nWe talked of his history and my own in extended groups of topics from fishing to art to puppies. I’d come to discover he was quite a well-rounded man of experience who had evidently cared so much for his wife and children when he was a younger man that his kindness had been taken as weakness and his family had exhausted most of his time and assets before he was shipped out to the desert to wither and die with the hundreds more just like him.  As he became more comfortable, we even talked about death itself and speculated how each of us might eventually kick our respective buckets.\n\nI didn’t share it with him but by the look of his frail, taut face and thin weathered body, he was sure to die of starvation if something wasn’t done soon.  I told him we have a food pantry I bring every Thursday morning and suggested he be first in line with a couple very large bags. It was the first smile he had given me all morning.\n\nI  used that smile  as an opportunity to fill him in on some things I thought we could do to help his situation and stretch his $718 monthly social security income and $14 in food stamps.  That brought the second smile of the morning.  I was on a roll and thought I might go for three and asked him to sit back against the wall as I used my IPhone to do for him what he’d come for.\n\nHe obliged, licked his fingers and briefly ran them through the few hairs on his head, straightening his beard in what was obviously his own idiosyncratic method  for many, many years.  I laughed as he did his little routine and told him my beard would never be as long as his but surely as grey.  And the instant he laughed, I snapped the picture  and showed him how great he looked in it.\n\nI’d have easily guessed he had not seen himself in a mirror for what might have been years the way he held my phone and gazed at his own image. His last picture was at the DMV four years prior.  He had aged quickly in four years. Very quickly.\n\n“Wow, you look very different from your ID picture, Al.”\n\n“I kinda guessed I might.   A lot has changed in four years.”\n\nAl shared with me had been diagnosed with inoperable colon cancer 3 years prior and at the last visit to his doctor, was told he probably wouldn’t make it to Thanksgiving.\n\nAl wanted a final picture of himself that could be displayed on his own grave wherever he might be buried like the many horizontal friends before him.  It wasn’t likely that his family would make the trip to see dad and grampa before he passed but if so, he wanted them to see the man he’d become just in case someday they became curious about what happened to old Al.\n\nHe said he could never figure out what he’d done wrong for them to not contact him again and hoped this picture of April 7th, 2015 might be different enough from how they knew him years before and that even from the grave, he might get a second chance to show them how much he had thought about them over the years and hoped they’d made lots of babies,  perhaps one named Al.\n\nI printed the picture and presented it to him for the fourth smile of the morning.  I don’t think he had had mustered four smiles in a morning for as many years.\n\nWith our work done…or perhaps just begun…he got up and shook my hand and thanked me for having stood in the doorway an hour ago.\n\nAnd as he left through the sunlight of that same doorway, I extended an invitation to Thanksgiving dinner at my house with my own three kids.\n\nThe fifth smile.\n\nI took another picture.",3,2

The ranch is gone, the children are gone and her binders of rhymes on the living room shelf will soon be tossed in the dumpster behind her one bedroom apartment, as forgotten as the unclaimed plastic box of her cremated remains.\n\nPeople, like icebergs on a slow melt, are not always what they seem. White and pale for years on the surface, they conceal so many layers of translucent centuries-buried colors, rarely seen by a disinterested mankind.  Like pages of a novel dissolved away  by the waves, the iceberg and its colors will soon be no more.\n\nAnd no one will know any different.\n\nI had done her a favor.\n\nLois had lost most of her sight in her old age and told me she was tired of pouring watery canned julienne carrots over her pasta.  Her tiny food pantry was mostly proceeds from the food bank  and she could no longer tell the difference between a label of vegetables over one of marinara.  I’d printed out stickers in 48point Helvetica bold and finally arrived to organize her pantry so that she could now tell the difference with a flashlight and the large magnifying glass she kept within easy grasp at the window sill.\n\nShe offered me toast and marmalade as a thank you which I declined mostly because I didn’t have the heart nor stomach to eat French’s mustard on a slice of bread.  Mental note for a return visit: refrigerator labels.\n\nWhile I needed to soon return to my regular post at the senior center outreach for which I’d left a note “Back in 45 minutes,” I didn’t know  at the time it would be at least two hours before my return.\n\nWalking behind her in her walker toward the sofa for a brief chat before leaving was tedious until I noticed the many white notebooks on the shelf, labeled Olivia, Jenny and the names of many others.  Inquiring, she invited me to take the volume Christopher home for the weekend knowing I was also a writer and much less of a poet. “I think you’ll like that one, Don.”  She went on to explain she wrote poetry as a young woman and had been published more times than she could remember.  Many of her poems had become greeting cards for Hallmark and before that, smaller card companies across the U.S. and abroad.  The bookends bracing her impressive collection were trophies for writing and poetry whose engravings had blurred and tarnished over the many years since she lost her sight and could only rub to read, which she’d done probably thousands of times since.\n\nWe talked of many things, including the ten children for which her binders were named, her little house on the prairie, the brevity of her fame before losing her sight, and her enduring fondness for capturing inspirational moments in her prose.  So immersed in her colorful stories of the past, I finally looked at my phone to see the time had come and gone to return to my post.  We said our goodbyes and it was my Friday, so I took Christopher and headed back to the office to pack up and enjoy my three day weekend.\n\n          “The saddest story in all of history will always be the one which went undiscovered and untold to no person nor pen and was buried alive eternally in an old soul.”\n\nThese were the words that came to me while I sat on my bed and had coffee with Christopher for three hours that Friday evening.  Reading the poems and prose, I didn’t cry even once.  It was probably a half dozen times or more.  The richness and antiquity of the words of that 91 year old prairie woman melted my soul, imagining that someday, with no one to claim them, the orphaned binders  Christopher, Olivia, Jenny and the seven others might end up in a dirty dumpster and a landfill, and probably very soon.\n\nIt was the weekend, and the days when I take care of my own aged mother .\n\nThough 35 years Lois’ junior, I wondered what stories I will have missed of my own family history if I didn’t take the opportunity that weekend to have a chat with her on the sofa that rainy afternoon.  I primed the pump with a few nostalgic recollections of our family and we had a few laughs as she played solitaire on her Kindle.  I could tell I’d begun to brew something more.  Her game slowed as small oral vignettes of her own family history emerged piecemeal and at random until she was telling me complete stories of times growing up in Storm Lake, Iowa on the farm.  Each story she told seemed to revive another she’d perhaps never told another. The kids she played with in the church across the street and the scolding of the pastor for playing hide and seek among the pews.  The memories of her parents and aunts and great grandparents were flowing in alternating waves of sadness and laughter.  Though they weren’t poetic, they were the stories of her life, and by distant relation, those I valued as my own.\n\nEach of us has a story to tell.  But in these electronic days, few take the time to listen in the way stories should be told.  Indeed, storytelling, the old fashioned way that families passed on their histories, values and expectations to the next generation, is a lost art.\n\nAnd out of 24 billion computers in the world, only a handful will find it important to pass on the stories of people who will otherwise soon be buried with them undiscovered and untold forever.\n\nIt was Monday morning again, and my day to return to the low income senior center where my outreach first introduced me to Lois and her many children. With Christopher tucked neatly under my arm, and a handful of refrigerator labels,  I arrived, closed up, and affixed a note on the door.\n\nIt read “Back in 2 hours.”\n\nThere are so many older Americans whose fame was never counted by measures of celebrity, celluloid or column inches in fabulous magazines, but whose life stories are noteworthy nonetheless.  And I have found that the aged ones who have never sought an audience for them, sometimes have the most engaging of all to tell.\n\nEspecially if you will take the time, ask, and then sit back with a coffee and some mustard toast, and listen.\n\nAnd bring your computer.\n\nDon Miller  #mygivingstory",3,2

She tells him no, she does not want to have that type of sex with him, but he doesn’t listen and he forces her. Afterwards, she is bruised, beaten and betrayed. She calls the police and is taken to the nearest hospital. Her boyfriend is arrested, but he may not even be held overnight and could be home before her. Already feeling violated and exposed, her clothing is taken from her as collection of evidence in the investigation and she is asked to wait in a room she can’t leave in nothing but a hospital gown, which after her assault makes her feel more exposed. The nurse shows a stranger into the room. He says he’s a volunteer advocate from Hope Haven of the Lowcountry, a child advocacy and rape crisis center. He begins telling her what Hope Haven is, how they offer counseling, legal services, medical referrals, and advocacy for her. He tells her that what happened to her is not her fault, and that what she was wearing, how sober she was, or who she had sex with in the past should ever be used as reasons to justify her rape. Rape is never justified. He tells her that the doctor is going to collect evidence from her body and it is going to make her feel more violated, but it is the best option to make sure she gets justice for the crime committed against her. She has the option to not report or to collect the evidence and report later. She decides to go through with the exam and all the evidence is collected. Afterwards, the advocate asks her about her safety and whether or not she wants to go home. She says she doesn’t feel safe. So, the advocate gives her the contact information for a local domestic abuse shelter and she calls and makes the arrangements. She spends the night at the hospital. But, before she goes to sleep she knows that tomorrow she has somewhere safe to go, that an advocate was by her side when no else could be, that her evidence was handled properly by the hospital and the detectives, and that tomorrow someone from the Hope Haven staff would be there for her.\n As a volunteer advocate, I’ve seen assault victims just like this one. I’ve been that stranger who had to walk into a hospital room and tell a victim that everything would be okay. I became a volunteer two years ago after graduating from college and moving back home to Beaufort, SC. I started volunteering at my church and that is where I learned about Hope Haven. After going to Mercer University and where I learned about the horrors of rape, sexual assault, and sex trafficking throughout the world, I wanted to do my small part to help within my community. After 25 hours of training, I learned how to be an advocate for victims of sexual assault, and how many obstacles they face when reporting their assault. I learned that most victims don’t report for fear of being blamed. I learned that 1 in 4 women will be assaulted in their lifetime and 1 in 6 men will be assaulted in theirs. I learned that only 6% of assailants will ever be convicted for their assault. And, I learned that rape and sexual assault are not far flung problems in big cities, foreign countries, and differing cultures across the sea, but is an epidemic worldwide, even in our own community. While this is usually a subject that many people choose to ignore, I stand with Hope Haven that it is an issue that needs discussion and more importantly needs action.\nHope Haven is the road to recovery for children and adult victims of trauma in 5 counties of the South Carolina Lowcountry. Last year, they serviced 544 clients with counselling, support groups, and advocacy, while also furthering prevention efforts in at-risk homes and local schools to stop the epidemic from spreading. While I hope I can make a small difference in the life of a victim, I know that Hope Haven makes all the difference in the world. Their biggest goal is to make every victim, their friends, family, and society around them, no longer see themselves as victims, but to empower them as survivors and help them get back to living life.\n",3,3

The powerful act of giving unto others is something I have always felt impassioned to express; however, for much of my life giving has been a challenge. In fact, my early experiences in life led me to demonstrate the polar opposite of giving by taking anything and everything I could. To understand the nature of this incredible transformation in my life it is helpful to view giving as a selfless act of love, and taking as a selfish act of fear. As a fearful child experiencing pain on a daily basis and perceiving many things beyond my control being taken away from me, both tangible and abstract, my survival revolved around an impulse to take what I could. My heart wanted to give, but my instincts told me to take. Naturally, living life in this mode only increased my pain. It is because of organizations like Hope Haven of the Lowcountry providing healing to children affected by abuse and neglect that I am able to give today. The individuals that come together to support and provide these services to the community are invaluable to improving the quality of life for everyone in our immediate environment, as well as the global community at large. From my experience, actions have a ripple effect and when we act from a place of selfless giving, rather than selfish consumption, we are spreading love and affecting others in empowering ways we cannot even begin to imagine.

I grow closer to God and as more children come into the house, I feel proud and see that there is the will to push myself a little further to help them. Then I get a little stronger and feel I am doing what one in a relationship with Jesus would do.

My sister and her husband began a non-profit, Legacy of Hope Foundation, in 2011. They sold their possessions and moved to Honduras with the vision to restore hope and inspire the lives of abandoned babies and children in crisis.  \n\nInitially, I was touched by Legacy of Hope’s goal to move away from orphanages and institutions by establishing a new model for abandoned children. They wish to implement a foster care system complete with trainings, home evaluations, and first-rights to adoptions. I was astonished when I learned that House of Hope was the only resource of its kind in all of Western Honduras, and that foster care, up until this point, was basically non-existent. \n\nI wasn’t sure exactly what I could do. After all, I was only a college student.\n\nHowever, I couldn’t stand the thought of all of these children lacking the stability, love, and support of a forever family. So, I decided to give back by giving my time.\n\nIt started out as a one year commitment. I accepted a volunteer position teaching preschool to the foster children living at House of Hope. Except, here I am, in Honduras, one year later and completely changed. Granted, I am still a full time college student and a part-time preschool teacher, but this story isn’t about me. Let me introduce you to four-year-old Thomas.\n\nDuring my second week back in Honduras and my first week back teaching preschool, I gave Thomas a pre-assessment of his colors, letters, numbers, and shapes. I concluded Thomas’s last assessment, shapes, with a heart. \n\nI asked him, “Thomas, what shape is this?” He said, “Es un corazón.” I said, “Good job buddy. Now, tell Tia Becca, what shape is this in English?” \n\nHe stopped and began pondering his response as he evaluated the shape’s physical form. He looked at the shape, traced it with his finger, and then a big smile came across his face.  \n\nTrying to ensure that I had his full attention, he placed his hand on my shoulder and looked deeply into my eyes. Then, his two little hands, finally coming to a rest, stopped directly over his heart. \n\nHe looked at the shape once more, smiled a half smile, and then stated matter of factly-“This. This is LOVE. YOU love ME.” \n\nA four-year-old stopped me in my tracks. He knew what love was on a profound level.\n\nAt that moment, I realized that I had become a part of restoring hope and inspiring the lives of each and everyone of these toddlers. I had become a part of their stories and they had become a part of mine. I am greeted each morning with squeals of joy and slobbery kisses from little tikes who are beyond excited to see me, their Tia Becca. And, more than that, House of Hope has given these children a loving forever family, with a mommy and a daddy and a bunch of brothers and sisters. These babies know they are loved because the Legacy of Hope Foundation exists. Through their initiation of foster care, how many more babies will get to feel and know that type of love? I don’t know the answer, but I sure can’t wait to find out. \n\nhttp://legacyofhopefoundation.org/\n",3,2

I am  beyond grateful for what I have in my life, such as; good health, a loving family, great friends, the ability to obtain an education and have clothes on my back everyday. One of my goals was to travel and see what else is going on in the world by going on a mission trip to another country. I did some research and was able to be linked to an organization that helps reduce the infant mortality rate in Honduras, Little Angels of Honduras, was the name of the organization. I raised the $1,500 all by myself in order to make this goal, a reality. \nOnce on the mission trip, I was one of 15 individuals who traveled to Honduras on this trip for 7 days. We stayed in places that did not have warm water, so showers were cold and meals had to be specifically made for us because we were not allowed to eat typical Honduran food because it would not sit well in our stomachs. Which made me more grateful for the showers I take and the food I ingest here in the United States. \nThroughout the trip, I met nurses and held newborn babies in the NICU of a Honduran hospital and learned about their struggles. That was especially close to my heart because I was born a pre-me just as those babies in the Honduran NICU were. So it opened my eyes to the medical supplies and staff I was lucky enough to have here in Buffalo at children`s hospital as compared to the lack of medical supplies and staff in Honduras. On the trip, myself and the team also helped rebuild, repaint and repair a medical facility in a village that serves roughly 1,500 community members. Those medical facilities are in multiple towns in Honduras because they are much easier to get to rather than traveling 4 hours to the closest hospital. So being apart of making a medical facility safer and stronger for the community members in Honduras, even though it was a small portion of the population, was huge to me. Along the trip we met doctors, nurses, farmers, pregnant mothers, children and fathers. So many people yet so many smiles. Every single individual we met was always smiling or laughing and welcomed us into their culture. Building relationships with these people, seeing a new culture and way of life and making an impact on their life was the biggest reward for me personally. \nIt warms my heart that I made an impact on at least 1 persons life while in Honduras. \nI decided to travel to Honduras with this amazing organization because I wanted a different outlook on life.

My dad was in and out of my life and my mother wasn't too sure on how to be a mother.  My grandmother, alongside with my grandfather, did a lot of my raising.  On top of absentee parents I also was in special education services.  I was labeled AU (high performing autism) and LD (learning disabled), on top of those I was in speech services as well.  I was picked on constantly in school and as I continued to grow in age my body begin to grow chunky and awkward.  By age 11 I was over weight and lethargic all the time, but age 12 I could barely manage to move without winding myself.  My father had summer custody when he decided to take me into the doctor to see why I had no energy.\n\nWe found out that I had leukemia and I was assigned to Dr. Lazarus.  I was in bad condition and needed extensive care.  I went through years of treatments, chemotherapy, and spinal taps.  I lost my hair - twice.  I lost my self especially for a preteen/teen.  I lost my friends.  And my mother basically abandoned me during the days to her mother - my grandmother.  Life was bleak, so bleak that I begin to contemplate suicide.\n\nThis is where Make-A-Wish came in.

While, I can tailor some of my lessons to inspire healthy minds and bodies in my students, five years ago, I felt I lacked specific tools to give students to empower them to live a healthier life.    This is when I heard of NaliniKIDS (NaliniKIDS.org) through a NBC news segment. I knew I instantly needed to bring this physical and social-emotional wellness program to my school.\n\nLuckily, the enthusiastic founder, Rupa Mehta, made time in her busy schedule and was sitting in my principal’s office in a few days.  I was instantly touched by her genuine desire to give her time and resources to make sure our students received the program.  It is fair to say that her generosity is contagious and made me want to give my time and resources to help her to expand NaliniKIDS into more classrooms.\n\nThe program involves a series of writing and discussion Common Core aligned activities correlated to the book, Connect to Your Self by Rupa Mehta.  These engaging lessons boost confidence while enhancing literacy skills and life skills.  The lessons are applicable to people of all ages and cultures. \nAfter the literary component, the students get moving!  They participate in a core based total body workout that stresses the importance of building strength, flexibility, endurance, and good posture (all tenets of emotional intelligence as well).\n\nMost importantly, the students apply the emotional and physical lessons beyond the classroom environment. In class, deep breathing and proper posture are reinforced. They utilize the lessons from the book to peacefully solve problems amongst each other and at home. They proudly boast about practicing pushups and stretches at home. They regularly implement the emotional and physical health tips.\n\nThe program originally began with Rupa and any volunteers she could enlist, coming to my classroom to teach the workout and guide the students through the mindfulness lessons.  The students were astonished that someone with famous clients would come from Manhattan just to teach them these lessons.  This reiterated to the students how important it is to care of their minds and bodies.  \nWhen other teachers saw the benefits that my students experienced, they too, wanted to see similar effects in their students.  Thus, it became time for the program to live beyond Rupa being the sole teacher.  \n\nThis need prompted me to spearhead a school initiative to train other teachers at my school.  I wanted to give back to the organization that had given so much to my students and my colleagues.\n\nOver the past few years, NaliniKIDS has grown at JHS 62, with now over fifteen teachers trained in the NaliniKIDS curriculum!  Teachers surveys and reflections all evidence how much both the teachers and students have improved their emotional intelligence and physical stamina because of NaliniKIDS’ generosity.   They also feel encompassed in a special community.  NaliniKIDS teachers and staff all feel that they have gained so much in their efforts to lose both emotional and physical weight. \n\nThis training has been provided to our school free of charge. My school has founds various ways to fund the required materials. I would love to empower NaliniKIDS to train and support even more teachers and students.  I hope that #givingtuesday will allow for NaliniKIDS to continue to expand in capacity, thereby empowering more youth to shed emotional and physical weight and see what they can gain by doing so.  \n",3,2

In the fall of 2013, our fourth grade class became dedicated to creating a class project that would merge learning with providing aid to people across the world. Jena, a student with special needs, suggested that our class support Nothing But Nets (http://nothingbutnets.net/), a global grassroots campaign which seeks to save lives by preventing malaria. Not only did she educate her peers, but she also opened our eyes to the fact that malaria is a leading killer of children, under the age of five.\n \nOur students quickly realized that in order to achieve this goal they would have to educate their schoolmates by developing empathy and building awareness of people’s conditions in sub-Saharan Africa. Collectively, they decided to create a campaign traveling from class to class, educating children about malaria and how to best prevent it.\n \nThe outpouring was resounding—we collected over $3,000 in change just from the students in our elementary school, in one-hour lunch periods over the course of three days. Our students experienced firsthand what it feels like to make a difference which impacted families just like their own, in sub-Saharan Africa.\n \nBecause of our work, we along with nine students and their families were invited to join Nothing But Nets at their inaugural Champions Summit to participate in a symposium which culminated in a day of lobbying on Capitol Hill. Our ten-year-olds sat in congressional offices, using bold voices to share their story and advocate for the appropriation of funding for the Global Fund and the President’s Malaria Initiative.\n \nThis powerful experience encouraged our new fourth grade class of 2014-2015, to continue our work. Our class adopted a motto to describe their efforts – Read to Learn, Write to Understand, Share to Teach. Our students cultivated interest through pamphlets, articles, poetry, comic strips, speeches, and PowerPoint presentations. The highlight of our efforts was a benefit concert that educated the community about malaria as a global health issue and bed nets as an effective way to prevent this disease. We raised over $1,000 for Nothing But Nets through this project.\n \nIn all of our various ongoing awareness raising projects, the curiosity in our student’s voices and twinkle in their eyes from fighting malaria serves as validation that our risk-taking in the classroom by way of service learning has delivered powerful results. We areteaching our students the importance of giving to others.\n",3,1

As we walked upstairs and peered behind doors, barren white walls showcased holes of punching and banging, sharp knives materializing perpendicularly, carvings screaming “I hate my life” and “I want to die.” And in the twin bed in the smallest bedroom a young girl was sound asleep. It was my job to wake her from her slumber with the jolting news of who I was and why I was there.\n\nOnce outside under the shadows of streetlights, she just came apart. Kicking my shins, slapping my arms, screaming, “I hate you. Just leave me here. I want to die.” The police officer stepped in, asking if he should do something. I told him no. Her actions were not an expression of malice but rather desperation, pain, and mostly release.\n\nDuring the drive to the social services office, we stopped for a midnight Happy Meal and bonded over teeny-bopper music. She was impressed I knew all the words. An important rule of social work, know your audience. While she slept on a couch with an old VHS playing in the background, I spent hours trying to find a safe place for her to call home. Once in “the life,” a sexually exploited individual has an average lifespan of just seven years*. I knew I had a golden opportunity, and if I didn’t make the right moves, she could be dead by sixteen.\n\nI drove away knowing in my heart that she needed more; she needed a place like Resilience Rising (www.resilience-rising.org). I hoped she would survive, her mother’s boyfriend, the johns, herself. A week later she tried to kill herself. The foster home refused to keep her. She was transferred to an inpatient psych ward at a local children’s hospital, her new home.\n\nThis child’s story is in every paintbrush stroke of the Resilience Rising house. I think of her while assembling furniture and writing our licensing application. I wonder how she would have fared here. For every nine-year-old like this one, there are thousands more, right here in the United States. It is time to bring them home.\n\n*U.S. Department of State’s “2014 Trafficking in Persons Report”",2,3

But after I did my interview and met some of the employees, I thought I might as well give it a go. One of my main jobs was to interview people in the community who benefited from organizations or programs that the United Way had helped. That's how I met Chloe. Chloe was a young girl that had been born with a heart disease that made her very fragile. She was unable to participate in a lot of activities because of the fear of her getting hurt or sick. Her only athletic outlet was brought to her by a local YMCA, a partner of the United Way, that offered swimming lessons for her. Because of the swimming lessons that were made possible by a United Way partner, she was able to not only grow athletically, but through her confidence and personality. I met many deserving people like Chloe, and went on to intern at a nonprofit health center later that year. After graduation, I ended up getting a job in marketing at a for profit business in town.

After a long week of training at my company's headquarters in Philadelphia, I flew up to Boston to meet up with a friend to take in the sights of this historic and vibrant city.  Little did I know that my world would change hours later in completely unexpected ways for these past 19 years.\n\nSince the weather had not been cooperative, we decided just to order in a meal of seafood chowder and a bottle of wine while taking in the movie, “Courage Under Fire,” which is pretty ironic giving the fact that a few hours later, without warning, my brain exploded.  Now I was  the one whose courage would be under fire!  Having been resuscitated after a grand mal seizure and respiratory arrest, I woke up an hour later in the ER at the Tufts/New England Medical Center with a circle of staff in scrubs peering down at me and firing off too many questions for my now damaged brain to comprehend.  As an ICU nurse, I knew immediately that I was in real trouble. \n\nThe next month turned out to be one of the difficult of my life, dealing with recovering from the craniotomy to clip the aneurysm, with complications from the surgery (including my ability to speak for some time), and ultimately the overwhelming task of beginning a recovery process.  There was no real support to be found anywhere, except among my former colleagues who understood perhaps even better than I did, how incredibly fortunate I was to have survived this.  My own maternal grandfather had died of an aneurysm at 42 years old; I had been 43.  It was the beginning of a very long and often lonely journey over many years...\n\nGradually, I educated myself by doing research about aneurysms. Initially I had been diagnosed with a second aneurysm that was still quite small and was to be monitored for signs that it was growing.  The thought that this could happen to me again was terrifying and the only way I knew to combat that terror was through knowledge and education.  With what I had learned, I truly wanted to work towards educating others but there were very few platforms on the internet of the day for sharing my experience with anyone.  One of the most critical elements of recovery is a source of support and education for survivors, their families, their caregivers, friends, and employers.  Then one day, I found a central, credible organization with of all kinds of information and tools on the Brain Aneurysm Foundation's website at http://www.bafound.org/.  It was a defining and very positive moment in my journey from that day forward.  I no longer had to perform without a net!\n\nOver time, I became involved as a volunteer and donor with the Foundation and began to find ways of reaching out to others in order to help raise awareness about this frequently silent killer of almost 30,000 Americans a year.  Although I was no longer able to work as a clinical nurse due to some of my cognitive deficits, working with the Foundation was a way for me to continue wearing my nurse's cap by participating in support groups and attending the BAF Lobby Congress day each May for the past several years.  This opportunity has allowed me to have a real voice, meet other survivors, meet the families of so many who have either lost loved ones to this condition or the caregivers of others who have survived but live with lifelong deficits and disabilities.  This has been so very gratifying on many different rewarding levels.\n\nMy dream is to one day fund a research chair for the Brain Aneurysm Foundation to advance research on improved detection and treatment of aneurysms.  Of great importance to me is creating a better national protocol for first responders and Emergency Medicine professionals to properly triage and diagnose aneurysm events in a more timely and consistent manner.  Once diagnosed, the choice of treatment must be determined expertly.  Sometimes this means transporting a patient to a facility that has the experience to treat brain injuries to effect the optimal outcome using “best practices” standards for care.  Sadly, we are not there yet in the current healthcare climate and too many lives are lost as a result.\n\nBy entering the 2015 Giving Tuesday competition, I am designating my non-profit organization is the Brain Aneurysm Foundation, whose url is http://www.bafound.org/ .

We had watched the eggs hatch, and the three baby chicks grow as they were lovingly tended and fed by Mom and Dad for weeks.\n  Suddenly, something was wrong.

They strung wire from the trees and installed a live video cam to show the thousands of people watching from around the world exactly what was happening.

I have a hard enough time piloting my body just for the purpose of circumnavigation, let alone artistic expression. The closest thing to an aesthetic experience I can muster with my body is a morbid awkwardness that you wouldn’t want to experience twice. I don't naturally dance, but thanks to Toledo School for the Arts, I understand dance. \n\nI first came to TSA as a student teacher during my last year of college. One of my formative experiences was chaperoning a dance. I thought the dances at TSA would be much like the dances of my high school experience: clutches of awkward teens shuffling in small circles of people that looked, talked, and thought like them in a contest to see who could look like they were having the least amount of fun. \n\nBut the TSA dance was very different. For one thing, the students danced together. Students that looked like they had nothing in common were all out there on the dance floor in a big heap. Mousy visual art majors danced with boisterous percussionists. Kids from the rich suburbs danced with kids from the projects. Kids who would have been relegated to a lonely corner in another high school found themselves the center of a roiling, laughing circle. And they all looked like they were having a great time. That's when I began to understand what dance is about, and what art in general is about. \n\nThere are aspects of this world that want to separate us. That want to stratify us. That want to keep us in an echo chamber populated by people who look like us, talk like us, and think like us. There are aspects of this world that want to keep us from The Other, that want to build walls around our little portion of the world until it seems like the only portion. That portion can be a lonely place. \n\nArt obliterates those walls. What is art but communication refined through discipline, precision, and sensitivity? When we partake in the arts, we are seeing the world as someone else sees it, and recognizing a reflection of our self in The Other. We are, however briefly, transcending the confines of our own parochial set of experiences and sharing something essentially human. Art is one of the few dance floors we all share. \n\nIt’s no wonder that I hear from students year after year about how this place has changed their lives. I’ve seen eyes well with tears when they tell me about what it was like before they came to TSA. The sad fact is, that many of our students come from places that wanted to keep them separate. Places where they were the weird kid. Places that told them that playing the viola is soft, that boys don’t do ballet, that girls can’t use a bandsaw to build a set, that they shouldn’t play with kids that look like that. Too often, kids come into the world surrounded by walls. \n\nAnd then they come to TSA and find themselves pulled out onto the dance floor. Every step, every plie, every stroke of the brush, every strike of the steel drum, and every memorized line is another sledgehammer through those walls. At TSA, students find themselves shoulder to shoulder with kids that aren’t ostensibly like them, but there they are understanding the world together through a jazz chorus, through a string quartet, through a poem. Suddenly, the world isn’t such a lonely place at all. That is how art saves lives, by breaking down the barriers that separate us. Art makes the world less lonely. \n\nThat's why I support Toledo School for the Arts. I want to help break down those barriers and help that kids have an experience that might not be accessible to them otherwise. I want to make the process of understanding other people a little more possible. I want to help rip the bricks out of all those walls, and use them to build a dance floor. \n",1,1

Previous years members of my church could take names from an Angel Tree and fulfill specific gift requests, there was no limit to how much could be given to an individual, if a child or adult had more than one item on their wish list you could select one or all, whatever you were able to provide. The request for gifts became so great that we were eventually asked to just donate any gift and it would be distributed to the community on a first-come-first-serve basis through an organized event taking place over a two day period. Community members already went through a paperwork process weeks prior to the event, then lined up and were allowed to select one gift per house member. Some people were unable to find an age appropriate gift for their family member, especially older kids and men. After seeing this need I spent the entire next year purchasing gifts to donate the following Christmas. It started with getting quality gifts on sale after the holiday. I always looked for bargains when I went shopping but it had to be a quality item, not something no one else wanted. I had coupons from department stores and an eye for finding a missed markdown. In February I came across a high shelf in the corner of a CVS store and everything was 90% off. I had to climb on a stack of beer and another customer got me a broom to reach some rocking horses, marked down to $2.99. After Valentine's Day I got large stuffed animals for $1.99. In March there were darling little girl outfits marked down to $4.97. In April I was able to get incredible deals at Macy's for quality young women and men's warm clothing. In May I found customer returns of winter coats in perfect condition, for less than $3 at Macy's. My bedroom looked like I was a hoarder as the months passes. But every time I went to Macy's, Target or Toys R Us I would find a great bargain. When the community giving event took place I waited until the second day the gifts were distributed  to take my full van of gifts to help ensure those who were far from the first to choose had a selection of quality gift.

This organization has been in existence for almost 30 years and in that time has invested around 1.5 million dollars in a small rural county in Maine. Every United Way is individually incorporated and run by a local board of directors. Many people do not realize that their local United Way is a separate entity from the national United Way. United Way of Oxford County has one staff person, their Executive Director. She works tirelessly to reach out into the community and is looking to bring programs that will create lasting change. Oxford County, Maine is a rural county made up of many small towns. In 2010 it was listed as the least healthy county in the state of Maine. Many organizations came together in response to start to work to make Oxford County a healthier county, and a greta place to live, work, and play. United Way of Oxford County has joined in this effort and is putting a lot of resources towards promoting health and wellness. It plays a large role in the Oxford County Wellness Collaborative, an organization made up of community members, businesses, and other nonprofits who are all working together to create a healthier Oxford County. Most recently, the Wellness Collaborative have started to dig deeper by making strategy maps that will incorporate measures and track real outcomes of initiatives created to improve community conditions. United Way of Oxford County has played a big role in this phase. This small nonprofit is also involved in other initiatives such as their Food Pantry Project where they coordinate food drives with local businesses and donate all items to local food pantries. So far in 2015 they have donated around 400 pounds of food through this initiative. This past summer they also ran a Backpack Project. Through donations from local businesses and foundations, United Way of Oxford County was able to stuff around 450 backpacks full of school supplies and donate them to the 5 school districts in the county. They also are planning to bring in some new projects in 2016. One is called the Dolly Parton Imagination Library. This program will mail a book to a child age 0-5 every month. By the time they enter into kindergarten the child will receive 60 books. The literacy rates in Oxford County are shockingly low and this program will be a step in the right direction to have kids get excited about reading and learning. United Way of Oxford County is currently in talks with partners to try to get this program up and running. The other project they are looking to bring to the county is a Diaper Drive.

My Mom was the first in her family to graduate with a four-year degree, my Dad was a lawyer. They both took me on numerous college visits and helped me organize the onslaught of college catalogs that rapidly multiplied my junior year of high school. I applied and was accepted to a small, liberal arts school in Burlington, VT where I had a truly wonderful college experience. I loved every minute of it - I did well academically, I was involved on campus and in the community, I studied abroad. I was incredibly lucky. However, when I graduated the economy was in the dumps. I left with a double major in psychology and theater, a minor in English. I wasn't exactly the most employable person. So I spent two years as an AmeriCorps VISTA member as a staff member in the service-learning department at two different universities, one in the Midwest, one in Oregon. There I watched my students struggle through school in ways that at first made me anxious and then made me angry. Students who didn't understand how to fill out loan paperwork signed off to receive tens of thousands of dollars for an education they didn't know if they wanted and that they would have to pay back for 15, 20, 25+ years after school. Students who desperately wanted to stay in school but couldn't afford the cost. Students who weren't receiving any personal attention and just dropped out with no idea of next steps. Students who learned their junior year that they hated their major when they final got to experience an internship but didn't want to change majors because they couldn't afford to keep taking classes. It was terrible. After my AmeriCorps experience I spent four years working with colleges in Oregon trying to provide support to students and staff. I wanted to create real change, however, despite the good my job did it equated to trying to put a Bandaid on severed limb. So, when my good friend and professor Michelle Jones told me that she was starting a new kind of college to address these issues head on, I was 100% in. I've spent the past year volunteering hundreds of hours of my time in support of the Wayfinding Academy. It's a new kind of college - small cohorts of 24 students start by spending their time asking big questions such as 'Who am I?' and 'What do I want to contribute to the world?' in rigorous but adventuresome classes. There are no majors. There are no checklists. The focus is strictly on the learning. And no one waits until their junior year to try something they think they might be interested in - it happens right away. Internships, apprenticeships, travel experiences, and community workshops are 50% of the curriculum. After two years students will understand what they care about, what they are good at, and how to put those together to create a life they love. And all this while paying a cost that's equivalent to a community college. The Wayfinding Academy promises that no student will leave without clear next steps, whether that’s a job, an internship, more schooling, or something else. I choose to volunteer my time and give my dollars to the Wayfinding Academy because I think it has the potential to change higher education, to offer a solution for the dozens of students I saw who felt like college was their only option (even when it wasn't their best option) or who graduated and now work jobs they hate all while paying off debt that they can't seem to get out of. I can’t imagine doing anything more meaningful for a cause I care so much about. Last month I was hired on to work at the Wayfinding Academy as one of our first full time employees. I'm honored to continue my support to this organization in this way and excited for the future. Thank you!",1,3

This is a welcome distraction for children who are away from home under oftentimes scary and unpleasant circumstances.\n\nWhat I like most about Y.E.S.S. is also the reason I have stuck with them over the years and the reason I plan to continue my support.  They are there to help those who are not in a position to help themselves.  In other words it is not just a hand-out and a pat on the back on the way out the door.  They not only provide for the immediate and most pressing needs such as food and shelter --  they go further to address the root of the problem and help the child get through a difficult time in his or her life.  My hope is the help provided, lessons learned, and the support received pays dividends throughout the child’s life. \n\nWhy am I telling my story to you?

I was able to read and write much better by then, however, from practicing it on a daily basis. I only watched TV programs in English and I was thrilled with closed caption which was totally new to me. I was very excited about this system that allowed me to enjoy my favorite TV programs as well as movies.\n\nMy speech and understanding English was causing me too much stress and anxiety as I was not able to even keep a simple basic conversation after much effort. I was applying the same methodology to learning English as when I learned Spanish from the best private hearing teacher, Dr. Margarita Postigo, when I was growing up back in the country where I was born. I recounted this experience in my story number 8. This methodology involved a great deal of commitment and a lot of discipline and yet I felt that I was getting nowhere. I decided to go see the hearing Doctor to find out where the problem was. \n\nThe Doctor explained to me the results from the hearing chart after running all different kinds of tests on my ears. The conclusion was that I am not able to hear at all some of the sounds that come from some of the different consonants, and I am unable to make a difference between all the different kinds of vowels—even wearing the best hearing aids on the market.  The doctor advised me to try to focus on getting a job where I only needed to speak Spanish and to stick to it to make my life easier with less stress and anxiety. I went back home very discouraged since that would surely limit my job opportunities to possibly only being able to work at McDonald’s or somewhere similar. This was hard to accept after I got myself prepared professionally in Peru.  Another limitation I had was that I did not know ASL (American Sign Language) as I had been taught to read lips while growing up instead.  \n\nMy angel friend encouraged me to believe in myself as well as to set my mind to learning English in my own way as long as I made it an enjoyable venture. \n\nI enrolled in Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) for the deaf for employment services to help me in engaging a job related to computers. \n\nThree months after my last appointment with my hearing doctor and with my recently U.S. work permit, I had my first job !!!. It was a data entry position using Quickbooks in Coral Gables - Miami. I never worked with any accounting system before and I took a risk to prove myself, learning it quickly on the job.  My boss was feeling frustrated trying to communicate with me in English as nobody in the office spoke Spanish and he had to write down on a paper for me what he wanted or send a lot of emails or Instant Messages to me all time. He eventually told me that he was about to fire me after 6 months but he took note of my computer skills as well as my determination to work harder with every assignment. Eventually I came to be the office manager which gave me the chance to work at the main office in downtown West Palm Beach for almost a year while living in a beautiful condo by the intra-coastal and Okechobee Blvd. with a view over Palm Beach Island and City Place.\n\nI was laid off from this job after 3 years, unfortunately, as a result of the recession following September 11 and I went back to Hialeah. \n\nI enrolled in Vocational Rehabilitation for deaf people for employment services again and I took advantage of the opportunity to study Microsoft Engineering certifications as it was paid for by the unemployment agency. I was referred to Abilities of Florida – Part of Service Source by VR as a client in order to get me a job in computers after I got my final certification as a Microsoft Engineer. Eventually I was hired directly by Abilities of Florida as a Contract Specialist. My first day at work was to fly to their headquarters in Clearwater. I was still having a lot of difficulties communicating with my co-workers in English but they were as understanding and patient with me as possible. Noticing the frustration from my co workers that had to work with me I was not able to comprehend why my boss, who happened to be the vice president for the big company, hired me instead of hiring someone else who spoke English without the hearing/speech difficulty I had.  \n\nThanks to the internet, I was able to keep in touch with all the offices that were my responsibility in Florida. Eventually my boss made it clear to me her reasons for hiring me when she picked me up at the airport in Tallahasee which is the capital of the U.S. state of Florida.  She made the point that I was qualified for this Job professionally and advised me also to look at the bright side of being deaf as all the offices needed to report to me by email in order to accommodate me. I was able to forward copy only of the most important emails to the headquarters, especially to resolve problems. In this way it was more efficient and convenient to resolve issues professionally and properly on time. \n\nI received training from a very nice woman who was also a very experienced contracts specialist working at the headquarters in Clearwater. She had zero tolerance for errors and pushed me very hard to be very committed and disciplined in order to meet the deadlines and she came to be one of my very good friends. I keep in touch with her to this day and I owe her a lot as I learned how to work in the U.S. professionally.\n\nI decided to design a whole new database from scratch. Setting up this whole new system took a lot of effort and time but it allowed me to be more efficient on the job in dealing with all the different offices when it came to providing all the different services to clients with disabilities. Eventually they benefited from getting the services faster and this was something I could very much relate to. Of course, production for the company also increased a lot as we were able to bill for government funds more efficiently. I was awarded the title of “Best Contracts Specialist” for the whole state of Florida - year 2006 - as a result \n\nI never forget 6 months before I was honored as Best Contracts Specialist that I was asked to fly to the headquarters in Clearwater and my boss gave an order to my co-workers who were contracts specialists to introduce me to the key person from the accounting department.  She happened to be a very nice professional lady with a speech problem. I could not understand at all a word she said as I am hearing impaired and also I was not able to read her lips at all as she had a severe speech impediment.  I went back looking for my boss and my fellow contracts specialists but they were suddenly all gone!!!.  I went back to the accounting department with a determination to find a way to make it work in order for me to finish the database.   The following year she also received an award by the company. This made me very happy because she deserved it. \n\nI worked for another private company around 2 years after I finished working for Abilities of Florida.  I got hired to be the only engineer in charge of the whole network for a new building. It was a huge challenge for me.  I never forget the day the whole building lost internet connection by noon and I could not figure out the origin of the problem and everybody left the offices earlier this day. My boss warned me not to bother coming back the next day if the problem was not fixed.  I worked alone until midnight and I was finally able to find the problem and fix it after I pulled out all the cables from every device and set them all up again.  My position was terminated by this company eventually and I decided to go back to College. I finished it with honors which allowed me to work for another big and important company. I recounted this experience in my story number 1. \n\nAfter reviewing this story, I never got fired, just laid off.\n\nI finally learned to be my own person with better control over myself and with more independence. I never ever imagined I would ever find myself in this situation which allowed me to venture into different personal projects as well as to feel more confident and happy with myself. To always try to confront and resolve my personal issues resulting from a lot of stress, anxiety and others, to learn to ask for help when needed and overall to never lose faith.\n\nhttp://www.enriquecastro.us/",3,2

Luckily, I was a good student and did well throughout my 12 years of public school and when it came time to apply to college I did so with a hope that I would be accepted and I would figure out a way to pay.  I heard back and was accepted to the only college I applied to and I was blessed with an academic scholarship.\n\nI convinced my parents to let me go and I had an unbelievable experience!  While I was at school I had a conversation with my parents about volunteering somewhere and they encouraged me to visit the local YMCA.  My family had participated at the Y when I was younger and my brothers and I all learned to swim at the Y.  So, I went to the local Y and became a volunteer, after a few months I became a part-time staff member working with youth in a variety of programs.  Most of the kids I was working with had received a scholarship to participate in Y programs, their parents couldn’t afford the fees and the Y was not going to turn them away.  What I never realized was what the Y and its programs did for kids; it was eye opening!  Watching a four year old gain confidence and believe in himself was amazing.  You could see it happening right before your eyes, like it was happening in slow motion.  I worked with a group of teen girls that were from different parts of town (not the best parts) and initially they felt like they didn’t belong at the Y.  Why would the Y let girls like them in?  They never imagined they would go to college or have great careers.  They were going to be like other members of their family – maybe in a gang or pregnant before graduation or even dropout of high school.  Over time and through their participation at the Y their perspectives changed; they were welcome and it became their Y.  They started talking about going to college and asking for help with their homework.   They talked about what kind of jobs they’d like have.  Again, it was incredible what happened to these girls through their participation at the Y.\n\nMy life was changed forever because I received that scholarship to attend college and I have accomplished things, met people and visited places I would have never imagined because of that opportunity.  I am convinced that the YMCA forever changes kids lives on a daily basis.  The Y gives kids opportunities to achieve, to be successful, to be a part of team, to have dreams, to be engaged with positive role models and to meet and interact with a variety of people.  I know that these kids will change the world and I believe it’s because someone gave them a chance.

FALSE,1,0,1,42313.64499,173.54.1.74,26-2115082,FALSE,TRUE,46748,"Why I fly.\nI am a pilot. I don't fly for a living, but sometimes I think flying makes me feel the most alive - especially Angel Flights. Angelflight Northeast (http://www.angelflightne.org/) is a volunteer organization which matches experienced private pilots with medical patients who require transportation to/from treatment and examinations far away from their homes.  Since 2004, I have flown more than 200 missions covering more than 100,000 miles.  This is the story of my first one which still provides the inspiration for all that follow:\n\nI first became aware of Angelflight through a pilot friend who is also a pediatrician.  I was a newly certificated private pilot with less than 200 hours of flight time.  Dr. Mike asked me about my flying, 'Have you run out of places to go yet and people to go with?' I was surprised by his question. I knew exactly what he meant, but thought that was just me, a new pilot limited to VFR with only divorced men and teenagers as eager and available passengers. I sheepishly shook my head in agreement and he asked me, 'What are you doing on Thursday? I have a flight from Boston to Bangor.  I could use a co-pilot to manage the radios.'\n\nMike didn't have to ask twice. I was excited to fly into Logan. I met him on the ramp at Morristown as we had planned and off we went. In route Mike explained the purpose of the flight. I felt a bit foolish that it didn't occur to me to ask.  I was so engaged by the adventure it really didn't matter why (or so I thought then).'It's an Angelflight,' he said.  I had no idea what he was saying.  He continued with more detail.  It sounded like a nice gesture.  “As  long as we are going that way, why not offer someone a ride who needs it,” I chimed in.  Mike corrected me, 'No, this is the reason we are going that way. There is no other purpose for this flight beyond bringing this guy and his sister back to Maine.'\n\nWow, I knew Mike as a good guy and committed physician, but coming from NJ this was going to be an all-day deal burning lots of expensive fuel. My definition of charitable and generous just elevated to an entirely new level.\n\nWe were supposed to meet John and his sister at the Signature terminal at Logan.  Instead, we taxied up to a black SUV waiting near where the lineman directed us to park. When we cut the engine the two got out and approached. Right away I saw John's face. Rather, I saw that he was missing much of his face. It wasn’t clear if the damage was surgical or scaring from burns.  He used a small hand towel in front of where his mouth should be to prevent him from drooling on his shirt.  I tried not to stare. It was hard.  John's sister explained that when they can avoid waiting in the FBO they do and today Signature provided them with the ramp service and car. \n\nAfter taking some fuel, signing the papers and a bathroom stop for me and Mike, we were off to Bangor. The flight was smooth and the winds were light.  As we flew along Mike and I didn't speak about John or Angelflight.  It was all business in the cockpit. But I distinctly remember two thoughts that were gaining traction in my head.  The first was about my father, who died of cancer almost 25 years ago.  He struggled for many months and there came a time when he was unable to get to his treatments alone.  Although he lived in the City close by to the hospital, he still needed someone to assist him in getting there.  While I tried my best to be available, it was sometimes difficult.  He had good neighbors.  These were not necessarily people who knew him well other than that he was battling an illness and needed help. I tried to recall some of those folks who showed this kindness to my Dad.  I couldn't and wondered if I should feel badly about that.\n\nThe second thought I had during the flight was something a rabbi friend taught me.  We all have an obligation to make the world a better place; not only for our family, but for others too.  That making it better can also mean making it easier.  Even though there are so many people who experience difficulty, and there is so much suffering, we cannot shirk from this responsibility simply because we cannot complete it.  I cannot solve global hunger but I can give a good meal to a person in need.  Judaism teaches that when you help just a single person in a meaningful way, it is as though you save the world.\n\nWe landed smoothly in Maine. Mike is a good pilot. We rolled up to the FBO and shut down. We helped John and his sister from the plane. John never spoke, but he looked at me with the saddest eyes I have ever seen. I felt like he was communicating a ‘thank you’ and I nodded a ‘your welcome’ in return.  His sister spoke. “Thank you so much. You guys are great. I don’t know what we would without you.  John won’t do big airports and public places, too many people point and stare. It is too long a drive for him in the car with too many stops along the way. If it wasn’t for AngelFlight, I am not sure he would ever leave the house. But getting to Boston for treatment is the only thing that can help him. Thank you, Thank you. You really are Angels.”\n\nShe wasn’t crying. But I was.  It was in that moment that I knew why I am supposed to fly. \n",3,2

This story touched my heart in a sureal way. As I looked at the faces of the people in need of water, my heart went out to them. I knew I had to help. The next year, I started Walk a Mile in Her Shoes; knowing that women had to sometimes walk up to ten miles to retrieve filthy water, I wanted people experience a little bit of this. The way it works is everyone participating in the walk either collects sponsors (who will sponsor them for every mile they will walk) or flat donations. On the day of the walk, everyone walks as many miles as they can or want to. My second grade year, I walked ten miles. After the walk is done, all of the money is collected and sent to Marion Medical Missions, and they build the wells in Africa. A well costs $400 dollars, and can save a whole village. My church has paid for hundreds of wells. Knowing that God has helped thousands of people through us is an extremely humbling thing. In America we take so much for granted because we have access to everything we could ever want. Water seems so insignificant to us, but to these people, it means life or death. Receiving pictures of the villages around their news wells touches my heart so much. Every year when my feet are weary from walking, I smile because know that's a few hundred lives that have been saved. It's amazing to see how something so simple can impact people in such a big way, and I thank God for giving me this idea to start Walk a Mile in Her Shoes. ",3,3

These characteristics enable her/her organization to survive. She sustains ecycling, since established in the early 2000’s. From the moment we encountered each other at a then-quarterly St. Louis County/DOH- Waste Management Group Luncheon wherein we discussed and worked on thereafter to establish 10 permanent E-cycle St. Louis Sites, she has always stated she “wanted to do things right!” It took a while for E-cycle St. Louis to get up and running, but Angela/WITS continues to ‘do things right’!\n\nWITS is still doing business and was instrumental in ‘bringing collection units/trucks” TO events vs. events coming to her/WITS. Causing evolution to happen, since her business always issues tax receipts for peoples’ donations, her process was holding up traffic in our annual Earth Day’s and Chesterfield/MO/America RE/Ecycle Drive-Thru’s. To address safety issues, we evolved to ‘Ecycle Saturdays’ involving every fourth Saturday of the month, 10 months a year. No more slow drive-thru lines exist since she first relocated to our Chesterfield Valley Athletic Complex parking lot area. After a few years there and due to mixed sports play off’s, she had to relocate to The Chesterfield Mall parking lots! Since the Mall told her recently that she will have to leave the Mall site due to development, evolution happened again! Now, she/WITS will relocate for E-cycle Saturdays to a new parking lot area at the corner of Baxter and Clayton Roads, following the same process for our community and region’s Ecycle Saturday’s.\n\nWhat Angela/WITS has collected through the years has kept pace with those re/ecyclables that were sustainable for her business. She has altered what WITS collects, to continually sustain the good purposes of: reuse, recycle, decycle, with plenty of education, training and compassion for the region, its children, ill children, underserved and older people wherever they are. Both young and old have become more technologically sophisticated, more self-reliant, and more emboldened to take care of or fix their own electronics, much of which would have been donated by Angela/WITS to them! Some people who she has trained have become employable, too! Besides all that this entails, she/WITS continues to donate refurbished electronics to those people mentioned: young and old, ill or underserved, impoverished and to schools.\n\nAngela/WITS employs people other businesses/organizations are not considering. Maybe this is a factor to help explain why WITS was broken into with recyclables, etc., stolen more than once since the early 2000’s. This was devastating each time. While Angela aggressively pursues grants, she has sustained this business due to knowing when to ask for help and donations when genuinely needed from other people, the Chesterfield Citizens Committee for the Environment, and my husband and me. I know there were many others, too. All of us realize the ‘greater good’ this serves.\n\nWhat Angela/WITS gives to society and our region cannot be bought or sold with dollars - - - it’s about an ethical commitment to society, good stewardship, and sustainability. I think many people have come to understand this. What Angela/WITS does is good for the economy, the environment, and the web-of-life. And, she works a second job to keep her household, too! While people stole material goods from WITS\n\nseveral times, it’s because of her commitment to ‘do things right’ that makes her into the business model our region has come to know. “Giving Tuesday” is a good time to give something back to this woman who helps sustain a resilient regional business model in St. Louis, Missouri.

My husband, was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder 20 years ago. Despite trying various medications and therapies, this gentle genius left a cherished career in clinical medicine due to having unpredictable and debilitating symptoms. I have ADHD and mood iproblems, as do both our son and daughter. In addition, our son is on the autism spectrum, and both chiildren are navigating life after high school. Our cars' bumper stickers should read 'Lord, let me be the kind of person my psychiatrist medicates me to be!'  \n\nBut, statistically we're NOT really unusual: one in four persons in the U.S. suffers from a significant disorder in mood, thought or anxiety at some point. This means that EVERYONE is affected by mental illness, whether in a family member, friend or acquaintance, a fellow driver on the highway, or even someone who decided to 'cope' through drug abuse, suicide or homicide. I suspect that if mental illness were adequately addressed, most of our prisons would probably close, saving much more money than would be laid out in additional mental health treatment!  Because mental illness is not as well understood as other physical disorders, it is often not diagnosed and treated effectively. As mentioned above,this can have drastic effects on one's function, especially if it results in harmful or illegal behaviors. \n\nNAMI, the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, is a lifeline for persons with mental illness and their loved ones. The first message of NAMI is that 'you are not alone.' This national nonprofit organization touches lives through education, support and advocacy, with support of research, conventions, publications and local chapters. NAMI successfully lobbied for equal coverage of mental health treatment in health insurance benefits, a tangiible benefit to many consumers.\n\nIn the past few years my family has supported our local NAMI Memphis chapter with both time and money, getting involved with self-help groups and monthly educational meetings. I participated in a workshop when dealing with 2 adolescents particularly discouraged me.  It's normal for relationships in families affected by mental illness to be under additional stress. Learning the '3 C's'--that I didn't cause it (the illness), can't control it, and can't cure it, has definitely helped me stay more realistic in dealing with my family. So many with mental illness don't know how to navigate the complicated medical and governmental systems that can help them. Both Sandra and Veronique, the staff in the local office, spend countless hours assisting others with referrals to local resources and organizing outreach, educational and support activities, all while coping with family members who can be mentally unstable themselves. They do this on a shoestring budget: Memphis is not a wealthy city, and people with mental illness are often not in a position to donate since they're strapped financially from trying to pay for medicines on  incomes affected by their mental conditiions.  \n\nInvesting in NAMI helps all of us in this society by increasing our understanding of brain and behavior, and encouraging those with mental illness to deal with their conditions in a positive , life-affirming manner.",1,4
